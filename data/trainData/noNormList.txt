DOCUMENT OVERVIEW - HOW IS IT STRUCTURED?

Schedule and Clauses: The Agreement starts with the "Schedule", which describes the specific purpose, parties, services, payment details and standards applying to the Agreement in respect of an individual deal.

The Schedule Parts precede the standard clauses (the "Clauses") for providing services to, or for, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).

The Schedule allows for the specific details to be entered that make the Clauses effective.

Some Parts of the Schedule describe essential issues (eg, the Grant and Payment).

Others enable the parties to cover optional issues (eg, financial incentives or IT connectivity).

Some Schedule Parts relate to Clauses that spell out the Commonwealth's requirements (eg, ensuring access to records for auditors and protecting privacy).

Signatures Page and Agreement Date: The Signature Page is where the parties indicate assent to this Agreement (ie, that they entered this Agreement from the "Agreement Date").

Under Schedule Part D, the parties' obligations may be expressed to occur before the specific "Agreement Date".

Cross-referencing names: Cross-referencing from the provisions of the Schedule Parts and the Clauses of the Agreement include a shorthand description for ease of reference.

This style of cross-referencing is encouraged for use in drafting Schedule Parts.

3 Scope and Application 
This Agreement shall be binding upon VCOSS and the Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (ASU) in respect of all persons who are eligible to join the ASU (whether members or not).

All employees excluding the Chief Executive Officer, including staff employed in projects auspiced by VCOSS, shall be employed in accordance with the Conditions of Employment as stated in this agreement.

4 Date of Operation 
This Agreement shall operate from the 1 July 2006 and shall operate until 30 June 2009.

A copy of the SACS Award can be accessed at http://www.airc.gov.au/awdsimp/lists/lists.html and is available from VCOSS JCC representatives.

In the event of any inconsistency between the incorporated award terms and the other terms of this agreement, the agreement prevails to the extent of the inconsistency, so far as the terms exceed the minimum entitlement set by the Award.

In the event that a term in this agreement fails to meet the basic Award entitlement, the Award entitlement will prevail.

In the Federal jurisdiction, this means negotiating an agreement under s170LJ of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.

The employer agrees that individual employee agreements including Australian Workplace Agreements made pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 will not be promoted, offered or made with any employee while this certified agreement remains in force.

Further, the parties agree that no employee shall be employed other than under the terms of this agreement.

The terms and conditions of the agreement shall be incorporated into the contract of employment of employees bound by this agreement.

This committee is committed to co-operatively and positively increase the efficiency and productivity of the organisation and to enhance the training, career opportunities and job security of employees within the organisation.

The Joint Consultative Committee will: 
* Oversee the implementation of the Certified Agreement 
* Plan and co-ordinate local workplace reform activity and ensure its progress 
* Operate effectively and co-operatively and meet at least at three monthly intervals.

* Be a forum for effective communication between management and employees 
* Conduct on-going reviews of all aspects of workplace reform, including OH&S 
* Committee representatives shall be allowed reasonable time to prepare and participate in the workings of the Committee and shall be adequately trained through an agreed process to perform their role in paid work time.

* The Committee shall consist of:
 the Chief Executive Officer,
 a staff member elected by the staff body, and 
 a union representative elected by ASU members of staff.

Changes to the representatives serving on the Joint Consultative Committee will be subject to consultation with and agreement from the staff body.

Elected positions are subject to re-election every 12 months.

This shall be undertaken in the following ways: 
* Exploring methods to increase the security of the employees' employment; 
* Increasing investment in the productive capacity of the organisation; 
* Giving preference to the internal workforces in any competitive tendering/ contracting out process; 
* Establishing agreed fixed minimum hours of employment for permanent part-time or casual employees.

Where agreement has been reached between the parties the agreed arrangements will form a supplementary agreement which shall be certified in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under the provisions of Section 170MD of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.

7 Status of Employment 
At the time of engagement, the employer will provide the employee with written advice of the terms of their employment, specifying whether they are full time, part time or casual and the duration of the contract where applicable.

The letter of offer should also outline the employee's classification and rate of pay and any other information relevant to the employment agreement.

Hours of Work.

An employee employed on a full-time basis will be entitled to the full benefits of this agreement.

Employees working on a part-time basis are entitled to the benefits of this agreement on a pro rata basis.

Salary.

Acknowledging that the organisation's operational needs will be taken into account, such requests shall not be unreasonably refused.

from 2 days per week to 4 days per week) under the same employment agreement.

Rates of pay for each project will be determined in accordance with clause 10 of this agreement.

Other staff members affected by such an arrangement should be consulted with during the appointment process.

All Fixed Term employees who are engaged for a period of more than 52 weeks, are deemed to be permanent employees for the purposes of determining continuity of service, relevant accrued entitlements and redundancy provisions.

Consultants or contractors will be engaged only in cases where specialist and or technical expertise or equipment is required and where the task is something not ordinarily to be done by staff employed under the EBA.

This includes part time staff (i.e.

That is, VCOSS cannot have two separate employment agreements with one staff member (as an employee and as a contractor or with a company owned by an employee).

The specific tasks, responsibilities and accountability pertaining to the position should be clarified and agreed to with line manager and Chief Executive Officer.

Included should be a time allocation where staff are to meet and ensure that the overall continuity of the position is not compromised.

Job share employees also have a responsibility to ensure that a high level of continuity exists between the two positions (for example, working on the same day at least two hours per week to allow handover of tasks).

If this offer is not taken up the position shall be filled following the VCOSS policy for appointment of staff (refer to clause 9 of this agreement).

An exception is when secondment occurs within VCOSS.

Procedure for secondment of staff from outside the organisation will be as per the short-term vacancy policy, however a secondment position does not need to be internally advertised.

Decisions regarding time frame should take into consideration funding and project realities.

After discussion and consultation with all concerned parties (eg.

other Unit staff) a decision will be made by the Chief Executive Officer.

The final decision will take into consideration the burden to VCOSS of 'filling' the vacated position, the time frame in question, staff development potential and the importance of sharing expertise across the sector.

As in other similar 'leave' applications, a staff member on secondment will have their position held open for them during their absence, subject to funding.

The decision to replace the staff member on leave of secondment is at the discretion of the Unit/ Project, taking into consideration the workload of the Unit and any other concurrent staff absences.

VCOSS will make every endeavour to provide opportunities for the retraining of staff for the purposes of redeployment.

A panel reflecting the criteria in clause 9.5.1, will use the key selection criteria within the position description to make a decision on whether the staff member has the skills to fulfil the tasks required of the new position.

If the panel is not satisfied that an internal applicant can fill a vacancy, then options for retraining will be considered and implemented by mutual agreement between panel and staff member.

If the number of retrenched employees is greater than the number of vacant positions within VCOSS, an interview process based on merit will form the basis of selection.

A position description will be made available to all applicants prior to interview.

7.10 Continuity of Service
For the purposes of calculating an employee's entitlements under this Agreement, continuity of service is not broken if:
* VCOSS continues to employ, or re-employs within 6 months, an employee who has completed a fixed term contract;
* by an absence on unpaid leave approved by the employer;
* an employee has been seconded to another employer.

The period of the break in service does not count toward the accrual of entitlements.

Continuity of service is broken where a redundancy is paid.

Further the employee shall give their employer documentary proof of their attendance, the duration of such attendance and the amount received in respect of such jury service.

Any new appointment (excluding Chief Executive Officer) will be advertised internally first.

All advertisements for vacant positions will be emailed to all internal staff.

With the exception of a short-term vacancy (refer to clause 9.3), if an internal selection procedure is not successful, vacancies will then be advertised externally, at the very least through Noticeboard, and/or a statewide or national daily newspaper.

All proposed new appointments must be approved by the Chief Executive Officer.

Position descriptions must be made available to all applicants.

If internal advertising is unsuccessful, suitably qualified people can be invited to apply.

Notwithstanding, internal staff will not be precluded from applying for any position that becomes available within VCOSS.

b) The above will not preclude existing VCOSS staff from filling a position in VCOSS in an acting capacity, due to the short-term absence of another staff member, (e.g.

sick leave, annual leave, maternity leave, long-service leave) or until an appointment is made in the event of a resignation.

In this instance the staff member filling the position will return to the position they held prior to the appointment.

c) The appointment of a person in an acting capacity to fill a short-term vacancy will be at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer after consultation with the Joint Consultative Committee.

These will be made available to all employees.

Position descriptions will be reviewed annually as part of the Performance Appraisal process, in order to ensure that the position description reflects the current duties of the role.

The position description shall not be altered by the employer except with the written consent of the employee.

Position descriptions may be reviewed and altered prior to the appointment of a new employee to a vacant position, in consultation with the Joint Consultative Committee.

Position descriptions will be made available to all applicants responding to the advertising of a vacancy.

Interview panels for all positions (excluding CEO position) will consist of: 
* CEO and/or line manager/ Project Co-ordinator of proposed position (Panel Co-ordinator) 
* one member of the Joint Consultative Committee 
* one non-management member of the Unit or Project &/or one independent person with expertise in the field 
Each of the above members may choose to delegate their authority to a coopted person who has specific expertise in the position being interviewed for.

Interview panels will not exceed four members.

A gender balance is required in every interview situation where practicable.

All unsuccessful applicants will be notified in writing as soon as possible.

Following the interviews, the co-ordinator of interview panel (as per clause 9.5.1) is to contact the referees of panel's recommended candidate, after consultation with CEO.

The Chief Executive Officer will endorse appointment with advice from interview panel and upon successful referee (and police check as appropriate) check.

The interview panel will notify unsuccessful interviewees within one week of interview.

* stationery;
* parking;

The employee must take the additional 4 weeks leave per year during school holiday times.

Flexitime provisions are to be used to manage staff time within the normal spread of hours.

All time-in-lieu (where possible) must be authorised by the line manager before it is accumulated.

Time in lieu should be recorded on the staff member's time sheet as accrued.

Time in lieu must be discussed with the line manager and approved accordingly.

VCOSS is obliged to review working hours and an employee's workload as part of the Performance Appraisal process.

As part of this process, employees who have accrued excessive hours of time in lieu, should be assisted with a plan to reduce the accrued hours and to ensure that the employee's workload is manageable within their specified working hours.

The payment of accrued time in lieu is not a standard practice at the time of resignation, however is open to negotiation between the employee and the Chief Executive Officer taking into consideration the following conditions:
* the ability of the organisation to delegate any of the employee's outstanding work requirements;
* the length of time in which the position is likely to be vacant and any handover requirements to the new employee;
* the normal daily workload of the position;
* the timing of the employee's departure around peak organisational events, eg.

Congress.

Time in Lieu Procedure 
Time in Lieu to be authorised by line manager.

The line manager and staff member to discuss appropriate time for TIL to be taken, taking into consideration the staff member's workplan, and any other operational requirements .

However, VCOSS aims to provide a comfortable and safe workplace, and all efforts are made to create an environment which is conducive to meeting employment obligations and which is worker friendly.

Agreement should be based on specific task allocation.

When working at home, staff are required to notify reception, giving details of when they will be back in the office and a number where they can be contacted (if required).

Work done at home shall be monitored, according to agreement between parties concerned.

In reaching agreement regarding working at home, line managers must take into consideration the staff members obligations at the office (e.g.

attending staff meetings, answering calls etc.)

in order to minimise the impact of their absence on other staff, and ensure that all Units are staffed.

It is preferable that staff do not carry forward into the following year an amount in excess of six weeks annual leave.

Part time staff will receive the above entitlements pro rata.

Staff who are absent from work because of illness for more than two days at a time must produce a medical certificate supplied by a recognised health practitioner.

No more than 10 single days in any one year may be taken without the production of a medical certificate.

Sick leave on either side of a Public Holiday will not be paid without a medical certificate.

Staff who are absent from work on any given day because of illness for any other reason, must where possible notify their line manager or reception , in the first instance, as soon as possible after 9.00am on that day.

The Co-ordinator of Administration will be responsible for maintaining the following records: 
* each staff member's sick leave entitlements; 
* use of all personal leave entitlements by each staff member; 
* the number of sick days taken by each staff member.

A "near relative" means:
* a spouse, partner or de facto partner;
* a dependent child; 
* a parent or step-parent (or parent-in-law)
* a sibling or a sibling of the employee's partner
* a grandparent or step-grandparent (or grandparent-in-law)
* another relative or close personal friend as agreed between the employer and the employee.

The line manager is to be notified of any application for bereavement/compassionate leave.

VCOSS will have responsibility for considering a request for additional sick leave for a period of up to four weeks annually.

This leave may not be accrued.

Staff will be required to use all personal leave entitlements prior to making an application for Exceptional Circumstances Leave.

Personal and family leave may be taken for reasons such as, but not limited to:
* traditional or customary leave;
* caring for a near relative (as defined in clause 13.3.

Bereavement / Compassionate Leave) 
* attending to the education of a dependent child;
* moving house.

where these tasks cannot reasonably be performed outside working hours and where alternative arrangements are either inappropriate, unavailable or impractical.

Entitlements will not accumulate from year to year.

Where the reason is the illness of a person requiring care or the usual caregiver, and the employee is absent for more than two consecutive days, the employee will provide a medical certificate.

Any staff member seeking to take study leave in a block would need to negotiate this with VCOSS.

In addition all staff are entitled to one day's study leave for exams plus leave on the day of the exam to a maximum of 4 days in total per year.

Additional time without loss of pay may be granted at the discretion of VCOSS .

In the case of employees hired on a part time basis, entitlement to study leave shall be pro rata.

Masters, PhD); 
* Secondment to a position; 
* Personal reasons (e.g.

parenting or caring responsibilities, travel).

Application for leave without pay is to be made in writing by a staff member to the Chief Executive Officer.

Application for leave without pay is only open to staff who have been employed by VCOSS for at least 12 months.

The application will need to outline the period of time and the purpose of the leave and staff will be required to give 3 months notice of the intention to take LWOP.

The Chief Executive Officer will be responsible for the final decision.

Staff may elect to take Paid Maternity leave over a longer period as agreed with the employer.

eg.

Staff may take 26 weeks leave paid at 50% of full salary.

Any remaining period of Maternity leave will be taken as unpaid leave of absence.

If during the period of paid Maternity leave, a pregnancy results in a stillbirth, the employee is entitled to complete the period of paid Maternity leave at full pay.

If during the period of paid Co-Parental leave, a pregnancy results in a stillbirth, the employee is entitled to complete the period of paid Co-Parental leave at full pay.

During the unpaid period of parental leave, further entitlements to sick leave, recreation leave and paid public holidays do not accrue and cannot, therefore, be used to extend the period of paid leave.

The employee will give at least 4 weeks notice, in writing, of their intention to commence Maternity Leave and the period of leave to be taken.

VCOSS recognises that commencement of Maternity Leave may not follow original intent and will be flexible and accommodating with changing circumstances provided that employees notify the employer of changes as soon as practical.

In addition, she may use accrued sick leave entitlements or a period of unpaid leave, as a registered medical practitioner certifies as necessary.

Co-Parental Leave
Where the pregnancy of a partner terminates after 20 weeks other then by the birth of a living child, then the employee is entitled to take up to one week of paid Special Co-Parental leave.

13.9.10 Returning to work
When an employee returns to work after a period of parental leave, VCOSS must provide the employee with similar duties at the same classification level to those performed immediately before the employee commenced parental leave.

Full-time staff being the primary care giver, will be entitled to negotiate a return to part-time work following parental leave.

In the interests of a smooth transition to part-time work, part time arrangements must be negotiated 4 weeks prior to returning to work.

13.9.11 Termination of Employment 
An employee may terminate her or his employment at any time during the period of leave by giving notice in accordance with this Agreement.

13.9.12 Replacement Employees
A replacement employee is an employee specifically engaged or temporarily promoted or transferred to fill a vacancy arising due to Parental Leave.

Before the employer employs a replacement employee or transfers an existing employee under this sub-clause, the employer will inform him or her of the temporary nature of the employment or transfer and of the rights of the employee who is being replaced.

This sub-clause does not imply that the employer is required to engage a replacement employee.

14 Public Holidays 
Staff are entitled to receive full pay for a public holiday that occurs on a regular working day for that staff member, as per the SACS Award.

VCOSS and an employee may agree to substitute another day for any of the public holidays prescribed at Clause 22 in the Social and Community Services - Victoria - Award 2000.

An agreement pursuant to the above shall be recorded in writing and be available to all affected employees and the ASU.

In addition, staff will be entitled to days off with full pay on the days falling between Boxing Day and New Years Day in recognition of the increased workload traditionally experienced by staff during December.

15 Harassment, Occupational Health and Safety, and Workplace Injury 
VCOSS is responsible for providing a working environment where employees are free from harassment, where it is safe to work, and where employees are assured of appropriate workplace support in the event of workplace injury.

VCOSS believes that all people have the right to work in an environment that is free of harassment.

VCOSS is committed to preventing all forms of harassment and redressing harassment where it has occurred.

Line managers /Chief Executive Officer are required to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and equitably and are not subject to harassment.

VCOSS will also ensure that complainants and witnesses are not victimised in any way.

Any reports of harassment will be treated seriously by VCOSS, and will be investigated thoroughly and confidentially.

Disciplinary action will be taken against anyone found to be guilty of harassing a co-worker.

Harassment is any form of verbal or physical behaviour that is uninvited, unwelcome and personally offensive to the recipient and creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.

Harassment may take the form of, but is not limited to: 
* sexism 
* racism 
* favouritism 
* victimisation 
* coercion 
* jokes or innuendo 
* torment, intimidation abuse or assault.

The parties share the concern that the rise in incidence may indicate ongoing workplace management issues that require attention.

The parties further acknowledge that prevention of work related stress would be a significant contributor to achieving reduction in the incidence of stress related illness and that the effectiveness of the outcomes from measures developed can be further enhanced by co-operative and collaborative efforts between the parties to this agreement.

), and relevant regulations and Codes of Practice.

The Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 states that: 
* Employers are required to provide and maintain a work environment that is safe and without risks to health for employees.

* Employees must not wilfully or recklessly interfere with or misuse anything provided in the interests of health, safety or welfare.

* Employees must not wilfully place at risk the health or safety of any person at the workplace.

VCOSS will: 
* Consult with relevant staff and occupational health and safety representatives in the workplace in relation to "work changes" and when selecting plant, equipment and substances with the aim of eliminating or reducing hazards at the workplace.

* Introduce occupational health and safety training programs aimed at maximising employee input to the identification, assessment and control of hazards.

* Provide effective rehabilitation of injured workers and an early return to work program.

* Accepts the provisions of section 29 and 30 of the 1985 Occupational Health and Safety Act (Vic.)

* Agree to establish and maintain an Occupational Health and Safety Committee (which may be as part of the Joint Consultative Committee as negotiated).

Any concerns about the state of the work environment will be directed to the OH&S Officers.

The officers will be responsible for addressing any concerns or raising them with the Chief Executive Officer to be resolved.

* Agree to provide access for approved training of elected Occupational Health and Safety Representatives to a maximum of 10 days in any two-year period.

All employees are required to report any injury to their line manager in the first instance and record the injury, in detail, in the Workplace Register.

This should include name of staff member, type of injury, date, time, place where injury occurred and name of the line manager notified.

The responsibility is then with the line manager to report the injury to the Occupational Health and Safety representative/s and to ensure proper procedure is being followed.

This may include ensuring that the staff member has been seen by a health practitioner and ongoing support and assessment is in place.

VCOSS agrees to provide relevant rehabilitation to employees who have suffered an injury or illness that is work-related.

VCOSS shall investigate the possibility of providing alternative duties to assist in the rehabilitation process in consultation with the rehabilitation provider.

16 Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action 
VCOSS is wholly committed to the principles of equal opportunity and affirmative action.

This commitment will require specific affirmative employment plans or arrangements aimed at overcoming barriers to employment that members of a particular group encounter.

Such active steps will be taken within the overall framework of establishing employment practices, a work environment which is free of discrimination and harassment (see Harassment policy) on the basis of a person's sex, marital status, disability (physical, intellectual, sensory or emotional), pregnancy, being a parent or childless, race, colour, national origin, age, sexual preference, political or religious belief or activity, general health including communicable diseases.

This policy commitment to achieving equality of employment opportunity applies to all phases of employment, including but not limited to, selection and appointment of personnel, promotion, training, staff, superannuation, compensation benefits and terms and conditions of employment.

All discriminatory behaviour is undesirable, may be unlawful and will not be tolerated.

VCOSS expects that all staff paid and unpaid will take responsibility for fair, non-discriminatory behaviour.

Any reports of discrimination against a staff member will be treated seriously by VCOSS, and will be investigated thoroughly and confidentially.

17 Conflict Resolution 
An employee who has a grievance arising out of his/her employment shall have the right for the grievance to be heard through each level of line management.

Similarly, where a conflict arises between two employees, both employees have the right to resolve the conflict in a considerate and timely manner.

VCOSS will make every effort to attempt to assist the employees in resolving the conflict, without prejudice.

This process can also be used to try to resolve personal conflict between two staff members.

It is not to be used as a disciplinary procedure - the correct process for a disciplinary procedure is outlined elsewhere in this agreement and when necessary will be adhered to.

It is expected that all parties involved in the process will attempt to keep the details of any conflict and the steps to resolve it confidential, however staff may seek support through JCC staff representatives, as required.

The employee will, in the first instance, approach the staff member they have an issue with and raise the matter directly with them.

This step may take the form of one informal meeting, or it may be a series of meetings as agreed by both parties.

In the case where the complaint is with the Chief Executive Officer, the staff member may seek the support of the President of the Board.

At this stage the line manager will assist in developing agreed strategies for Staff members to work on with an ongoing support and review process.

Either party may be represented by an employee or employer representative and/or the Joint Consultative Committee.

An employee representative or JCC may be present at the request of either party.

Australian Industrial Relations Commission or another mutually acceptable person or body for mediation, conciliation or arbitration.

The result of this process shall be accepted as final by both parties.

Health and Safety matters are exempted from this clause.

17.1.10 No party shall be prejudiced as to the final settlement by the continuation of work.

17.1.11 All employees shall be handed a copy of these procedures on commencement of employment.

The disciplinary procedure shall be fair and negotiable.

Discussion between management and staff is encouraged.

It is important to note that employees have the right to look at their personnel files and to make copies of documents held therein.

An appointment can be made with the Co-ordinator of Administration.

The employee in question is told by their line manager as soon as possible of any complaint concerning the performance of their work.

2.

Complaints must be specific in nature, citing specific examples, including times and dates relating to the complaint.

not "s/he doesn't get along with the team" - this is a grievance).

3.

The Complaint is to be discussed with the employee and the line manager (as the employer representative), who will mutually determine a strategy to improve/eliminate the behaviour in question.

The staff member is entitled to have an employee representative or another 'support' person present at the discussion.

4.

The Verbal warning is recorded on file.

5.

The employee shall be given the opportunity to sign the entry and be given a copy of the entry.

If the employee declines to sign the entry, the record will be endorsed to that effect by management.

6.

At the expiration of twelve months, if no further related difficulty has occurred the warning shall be removed from the staff members file.

First Written Warning 
1.

If the problem continues or occurs again after the verbal warning, the employee may be given written notice of the complaint/s against them.

Again the complaints must cite specific examples, including times and dates.

2.

The matter is then reported to the Chief Executive Officer.

At all times confidentiality should be maintained to minimise loss of confidence and respect.

A representative of VCOSS management will then meet with the staff member.

The staff member then has the opportunity to discuss the complaints made against them.

The staff member is entitled to be represented by an employee representative of their choice.

3.

The aim of the meeting is to result in a change in the inappropriate behaviour but if this is not possible the two parties should negotiate how the situation may be improved.

A trial period is set during which certain changes should occur.

A date is then set to review the agreed changes.

4.

A review takes place after this trial period.

A written record of this meeting should be placed on the staff members file.

5.

After this the dispute may be resolved and there may be no need for further action.

6.

The employee shall be given the opportunity to sign the entry and be given a copy of the entry.

If the employee declines to sign the entry, the record will be endorsed to that effect by management.

7.

At the expiration of twelve months, if no further related difficulty has occurred the warnings shall be removed from the staff members file.

Final Written Warning 
1.

If the problem persists, another meeting is called by the Chief Executive Officer and the employee is given notice to attend.

2.

The employee has the right of reply to discuss the situation.

They are also entitled to have an employee representative of their choice attend the meeting.

3.

The matter is discussed and further action may be considered.

Both parties need to negotiate what this action might be and the employee is given written notice (a final written warning).

Again an accurate record of this meeting should be placed on file.

4.

The employee shall be given the opportunity to sign the entry and be given a copy of the entry.

If the employee declines to sign the entry, the record will be endorsed to that effect by management 
5.

If this meeting resolves the dispute there is no need for further action.

6.

At the expiration of twelve months, if no further related difficulty has occurred the warnings shall be removed from the staff members file.

If the problem still continues after these three warnings, the staff member will be required to attend a further meeting at which a decision regarding the future employment of the employee in question will be made.

The employee may be dismissed after three warnings have been given.

If dismissed, the staff member will be given notice (4 weeks payment in lieu of notice).

Whilst at any stage, either party may refer the matter to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, VCOSS strongly recommends that both parties make reasonable attempts to resolve the issue/s using the above process.

Management may also consider alternatives like a formal "dispute resolution meeting" to further attempt to resolve the problem before deciding on termination.

18 Training and Development 
VCOSS recognises that in order to increase efficiency, productivity and to enhance work satisfaction and career development, a commitment to training and skill development is necessary.

Accordingly, the organisation commits to provide employees with access to mutually agreed training opportunities , and paid leave will be granted to employees for the purpose of pursuing training opportunities.

An amount at least equal to 1.5% of staff salary budgets will be available for this purpose and spent according to organisational planning arrangements.

19 Industrial Relations 
VCOSS is committed to: 
* Developing and maintaining constructive on-going interaction between VCOSS, employees and the employee industrial representative organisation party to this agreement.

* Agreed objectives for the organisation.

* Respecting the rights of employees to engage in Union activities.

* Effective prevention and settlement of industrial disputes.

* Regular consultation and communication, and the establishment of an appropriate forum for such consultation between the employer/ employee and the employee industrial representative organisation party to this agreement.

All workplace representatives shall be entitled to paid training leave.

All EEO and OHS representatives shall be entitled to 5 days per year training leave.

The costs of this will be attributed to the core of the organisation, not any particular service or business unit.

Part timers shall get full entitlements.

The employee may negotiate with their line manager to alter the notice period after the resignation has been submitted.

An employee will not be dismissed without regard to the Disciplinary Procedure as outlined in clause 17.2.

An employee dismissed under this clause, will be entitled to receive 4 weeks pay in lieu of notice.

Serious misconduct includes the following: 
* wilful misconduct, that is serious in nature and that compromises the organisation;
* dishonesty of the employee in relation to the employment;
* commission of a crime in the course of employment;
* commission of a crime outside the course of employment which is relevant to the duties of the employee and compromises the organisation; 
* neglect of duty which happens on a regular basis and is of a serious nature; and
* abandonment of employment.

An employee that is instantly dismissed shall not be entitled to payment in lieu of notice.

In such a case, the line manager has a responsibility to inform staff members that the position is redundant and to investigate avenues to redeploy.

If redeployment is not possible, the Award provisions will apply (Termination of employment and Redundancy).

An employee should be notified of the redundancy as soon as possible, but not less than 4 weeks prior to the redundancy becoming effective.

VCOSS will make all efforts to avert or minimise disadvantage to individual employees.

VCOSS will demonstrate that there is no reasonable alternative to the proposed action and that other options have been canvassed.

All references must include the dates of the period of employment and the position title.

1.

BACKGROUND

1.1.

Following the bombing of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney in 1978 the Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth/State Cooperation for Protection Against Violence (SAC-PAV) was established to respond to terrorism.

SAC-PAV held its first meeting in 1979 and the National Anti-Terrorist Plan (NATP) was subsequently developed in 1980, based on cooperation between the Commonwealth, States and Territories.

1.2.

The new security environment, including the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 and in Bali on 12 October 2002, indicates that previous assumptions about the nature, potential scale and forms of terrorism may no longer be valid and require ongoing review.

1.3.

On 5 April 2002, the Prime Minister and State and Territory Leaders agreed that a new national framework was needed to meet the new challenges of combating terrorism.

The Leaders also reaffirmed the importance of effective cooperation between the jurisdictions and the need to build on existing arrangements in adding elements that would respond quickly and effectively to these challenges.

2.

AGREEMENT
2.1	The Commonwealth, State and Territory governments now enter into the following formal agreement to put into effect the outcomes of the Leaders' Summit in combating terrorism and to establish the basis, including details of governance, for the National Counter-Terrorism Committee (NCTC).

The Commonwealth, States and Territories agree:

Purpose

2.2	The Purpose of this Agreement is to establish a framework to enhance Australia's counter-terrorism capability through a cooperative partnership between all jurisdictions.

2.7	To assist in this, all jurisdictions will apply appropriate standards and arrangements for the protection of national security information.

3.

THE NATIONAL COUNTER-TERRORISM COMMITTEE

3.1	Commonwealth, States and Territories agree that the existing SAC-PAV will be reconstituted as the NCTC with a broader mandate to cover prevention and consequence management issues and with ministerial oversight arrangements.

3.2	The NCTC will be a high-level national body comprising representatives from the Commonwealth, States and Territories.

3.4	The terms of reference for the NCTC are at Annex A.

Accountability

3.5	The NCTC will report annually to the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers to facilitate ministerial oversight of the NCTC by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).

3.6	The appropriateness of continued ministerial oversight of the NCTC by COAG will be reviewed by COAG in 2005.

3.7	There will be a review of the national counter-terrorism arrangements every three years.

4.

It will be the primary document on Australia's national counter-terrorism policy and arrangements.

The NCTP will be supported by documentation, including a handbook, that sets out in detail the procedures, structures and coordination arrangements necessary to ensure the prevention, response, investigation and management of the consequences of terrorism on a national basis.

I ACKNOWLEDGE that:
a)	Rowing Activities can be inherently dangerous.

I am aware Rowing is a water borne activity that can be dangerous and that by engaging in any Rowing Activity (whether as a competitor, recreational rower, coach, official, media or other participant) I take and am exposed to certain risks and dangers and I acknowledge that I may be exposed to certain risks:
i)	that I may be injured, physically or mentally or risk death:
* the risks of physical injury may include, without limitation muscle strain, fractures, ligament injury; 
* the risks of mental injury may include, without limitation, risk of serious psychological and psychiatric injury; and

iv)	that regatta and rowing venues and event conditions may be hazardous and may vary without warning or predictability;
v)	that organisers, officials, landowners/venue operators and any agents or representatives of those in charge of an event or a Rowing Activity are frequently obliged to make decisions under pressure of time/or events;
vi)	that there may be no or inadequate facilities for treatment or transport of me if I am injured; and
vii)	that I have an obligation to myself and to others to act safely and within the rules and regulations of all Rowing Organisations and their affiliated organisations.

To the extent of any liability arising, the liability of the Rowing Organisation will, at the discretion of the Rowing Organisation, be limited in the case of goods, to the replacement, repair or payment of the cost of replacing the goods and in the case of services, the resupply of the services or payment of the cost of having the services supplied again; and
c)	I have voluntarily read and understood this warning and accept and assume the inherent risks in participating in the Rowing Activities.

5.

WARNING UNDER THE FAIR TRADING ACT 1999 (VIC) 
Under the provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1999 (Vic) several conditions are implied into contracts for the supply of certain goods and services.

These conditions mean that the supplier named on this form is required to ensure that the recreational services it supplies to you are:
- rendered with due care and skill;
- as fit for the purpose for which they are commonly bought as it is reasonable to expect in the circumstances; and
- reasonably fit for any particular purpose or might reasonably be expected to achieve any result you have made known to the supplier.

Under section 32N of the Fair Trading Act 1999, the supplier is entitled to ask you to agree that these conditions do not apply to you.

If you sign this form, you will be agreeing that your rights to sue the supplier or the Indemnitiees under the Fair Trading Act 1999 if you are killed or injured because the services were not rendered with due care and skill or they were not reasonably fit for their purpose, are excluded, restricted or modified in the way set out in this form.

NOTE: The change to your rights, as set out in this form, does not apply if your death or injury is due to gross negligence on the supplier's part.

"Gross negligence" is defined in the Fair Trading (Recreational Services) Regulations 2004.

For the purposes of the clause 5, "the Supplier" shall mean and include the Indemnitees.

6.

6.

CANDIDATE'S COMPETENCIES (INITIALLY)

Describe the competencies, experience and knowledge at the start of the training period here.

If that is not practical, provide them on an attachment and refer to it at paragraph 3.

This statement will assist the preparation of the training programme and its time schedule.

7.

SCOPE OF TRAINING

Append to the signed Agreement (as "Attachment A") section 5 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors, annotated if required to detail the training to be provided under this Agreement.

8 	LEVEL OF SUPERVISION

Append to the signed Agreement (as "Attachment B") section 6 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors, annotated as required to detail the level of supervision to be provided under this Agreement.

Strict supervision can only be relaxed as the candidate demonstrates that it is appropriate to do so.

The candidate's development depends on a progressively reduced level of supervision.

9.

EXCLUSIONS

If the company does not carry out some types of work (or some components of work), or use some type of equipment, which are essential or desirable for the candidate's development, they should be itemised.

The responsibility for attaining this experience should be allocated and if it is to be included within this training agreement the solution should be described.

If the excluded training is to be achieved through another surveyor and company but within the ambit of this agreement, the responsibility of the supervising surveyor and the other surveyor should be set out.

10	TIME SCHEDULE 

It is recommended that the agreement include a time schedule targeting dates for achievement of each of the competencies described in a "Scope of Training" (see Appendix A for an example).

This will allow both parties to monitor progress of the training, correct any identified problems and to understand the magnitude of the task from the start.

The candidate should participate in the preparation of the time schedule.

Attach the time schedule as Attachment C to the signed Agreement.

11	RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SUPERVISING SURVEYOR

The responsibilities of the supervising surveyor under this agreement are stated in section 7 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors.

Append a copy, annotated as required, as attachment D to the signed Agreement.

12.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CANDIDATE

The responsibilities of the candidate under this agreement are stated in section 8 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors.

13	ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPUTATION

It is recognised that the candidate (during this agreement and after accreditation) is a reflection on the supervisor and on the company (in fieldnotes, project work and direct relations with the client and the public).

The candidate's training is at least as important to the supervisor as the successful completion of survey jobs.

The supervisor and company will provide every possible tuition, guidance and opportunity, but the candidate will only be progressed to the next stage when ability is proven.

Despite any intention of the candidate to specialise once accredited by the Board, this training must give a balanced general training in all aspects of cadastral work.

Competency in all aspects must be demonstrated before the candidate should be recommended as competent to present for examination.

14.

TRAINING REPORTS

The candidate and the supervising surveyor will maintain the records required by section 9 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors and will submit training reports to the Board as required.

15.

DRAFT NUMBER 11.1.1998Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors

1.

Introduction1.INTRODUCTION

These guidelines are to inform supervising surveyors of their obligations and responsibilities in the training of candidates under a Professional Training Agreement.

Professional Training Agreements are taken very seriously by the Board.

Although the Board conducts final examinations of candidates prior to granting Certificates of Competency, it can only ever be a general indication of the competence of the candidates.

The real tests occur during the life of the Professional Training Agreement where the level of knowledge and character necessary to become a professional surveyor is determined by the supervising surveyor.

It is only when a candidate has achieved that standard in the mind of the supervisor that approval should be given for the candidate to present to the Board in the final examinations.

Poorly presented candidates reflect on the reputation of the supervising surveyor.

During the training agreement and after registration, the graduate surveyor is a reflection of the supervisor and on the company.

The supervisor and company should provide every possible tuition, guidance and opportunity and the candidate should only be progressed to the next stage when ability is proven.

Despite any intention of the candidate to specialise once registered, the training must give a balanced general training in all aspects of cadastral work.

Competency in all aspects must be demonstrated before the candidate is recommended for the examination.

These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the Surveyors Act 2002, the Surveyors Regulations 2003 and the Board's "Guidelines for Candidates Seeking a Certificate of Competency Leading to Registration Under the Surveyors Act 2002".

2.

Definitions2.DEFINITIONS

In these guidelines the following expressions have the following meanings:

?

"Board" means the Tasmanian Land Surveyors Accreditation Board.

?

"Candidate" means a undergraduate or graduate surveyor who is a party to a Professional Training Agreement.

?

"Supervising Surveyor" or "Supervisor" means a registered land surveyor who agrees to supervise a candidate under a Professional Training Agreement.

3.

The Professional Training Agreement3.THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AGREEMENT

The purpose of the professional training agreement (PTA) is to provide the candidate with a structured training program of education and professional development.

The PTA should be structured so as to enable the candidate to progress to the level of a competent professional surveyor in an efficient and effective manner.

The PTA should take into account local conditions and specialisations.

It should be prepared by the supervising surveyor in consultation with the candidate.

4.

Competency Standards4.COMPETENCY STANDARDS

The Institution of Surveyors Australia Incorporated (ISA) in conjunction with the Reciprocating Surveyors' Boards of Australia and New Zealand has developed "National Competency Standards for Professional Surveyors".

While those standards (published in July 1996) do not specifically deal with cadastral surveys, these guidelines are based on those general standards.

In particular, pages 51 through 66 of those National Competency Standards detail the necessary "Key Competencies" for stage 2 (equivalent to the period of a professional training agreement).

Supervisors are to ensure that candidates achieve the level of competency and professional development required by the Board as outlined herein and in the competency based standards for surveyors.

Candidates should be exposed to a variety of surveys and challenged by difficult and complex situations.

Supervisors are to ensure that any deficiencies in the candidate's skills are rectified.

The training should be broadly based, not specialised.

The training subjects that should be covered are detailed in guideline 5.

Some require full competence while others only require an awareness.

Two topics deserve special mention as they are vital to the ultimate professionalism of every surveyor-

?

Professional ethics should be impressed on the candidate both by example and by instruction throughout the period of the PTA; and

?

Leadership is a quality necessary to all surveyors.

5.

Skills and knowledge to be demonstrated5.SKILLS TO BE TAUGHT

In transforming the generic competencies to the specific cadastral area, the candidate should demonstrate the following competencies and, where appropriate, receive such training as is needed to acquire these competencies:

5.1	Safety
-	Safe working practices.

The learning of safe working practices must precede any other training.

5.2	Basic Practical Field Skills
-	Linear measurements using steel band and electronic distance measuring equipment,
-		Levelling, theodolite angle measurement, total stations
-		Global Positioning Systems, including real-time kinematic and differential GPS using a commercially broadcast correction.

-		Electronic and manual methods of data recording,
-		Placement and referencing of boundary and general survey marks,
-		Independent checking of observations and error-elimination procedures,
-		Use and maintenance of tools, equipment, and vehicles,
-		Safety procedures and safe work practices.

5.3	 Re-Establishment Of Alignments
-	Location of old survey marks and occupation
-	Re-establishment of title boundaries through the analysis of available evidence,
-	Determination of adoptions based on the principles associated with crown boundaries, previous surveys, survey marks, and occupation.

5.4	 Map, Geodetic And Height Datums
-	Field surveys based on the Australian Geodetic Datum, its derivation the Australian Map Grid, and the Australian Height Datum.

-	The Geocentric Datum Australia.

-	The dependence of Global Positioning System surveys upon these datums.

5.5	 Accuracy
-	The standards of accuracy required in field surveys.

-	How to achieve the necessary standard in each situation encountered.

5.6	 Team Leadership
-	Staff supervision and field party leadership,
 -	Responsible use of vehicles and equipment,
 -	Bushcraft, especially in remote areas,
 -	Responsibility for the team.

5.7	 Survey Information
-	Searching and interpretation of title and survey information from the appropriate sources.

-	The relevance and availability and use of this analogue and digital information, (not necessarily familiarity with the physical actions of obtaining the information).

5.8	 Survey Computations
-	Computer hardware and software and their applications to surveying and a surveying practice in general.

-	The application of general survey computations learned in the university course.

-	Calculation of re-establishment of cadastral alignments:-
*	including distribution of original errors into the most probably correct places;
*	achieving a best fit of boundaries to available original marks and dimensions; and
*	taking into account legal implications.

5.9	 Drafting
-	Familiarity with the different requirements (regulations, guidelines and conventions) for drafting plans under the various land tenure Acts - sufficient to instruct and control the drafting, not necessarily enough to physically draft the plans personally.

5.10 Documentation
-	Preparation of the other survey and business documentation related to surveys (eg field notes, sketch plans, applications, reports and correspondence).

5.11 Calibration
-	Understanding of the need for repeated calibration of equipment, and competency in the calibration of all equipment and instruments used.

5.12 Ethics
-	Ethics, as apply to a professional person generally, and as apply to a registered land surveyor in particular.

5.13 Statutory Common Law Requirements
-	Familiarity with the various Acts, regulations, directions, guidelines and manuals relevant to a survey practice.

-	Awareness of Common Law as it affects land tenure.

-	Sound knowledge of the various regulations, directions and guidelines related to cadastral surveys.

This should include the practices and procedures of the various survey registering agencies.

It is emphasised that training in the practical application of the regulations is essential.

Acts, regulations, directions, guidelines and procedures are now changing frequently, so it is necessary that library and knowledge be kept up to date.

5.14 Building Set-Out
-	Experience in building set-out or control with respect to a boundary (not necessarily multi-storey)

5.15 Total Subdivision Process
-	Experience of the total subdivision process, including local government, planning authorities, servicing authorities, engineering and finance.

5.20	Bringing general law land under the Land Titles Act.

5.21	Definition and re-establishment of tidal and non tidal riparian boundaries, the nature of those boundaries and the rights that are conferred.

It is expected that the candidate will be aware or familiar with the following subjects, 5.22 to 5.24, at the time of completion of the professional training agreement, and that following accreditation will work in a structure with limited guidance until competent in those subjects.

5.22	Knowledge of the nature of the different kinds of subdivision processes under the various Acts, the many opportunities they afford and the requirements of each.

5.23	Subdivision design and options and optimisation.

5.24	Understanding clients needs and guiding their instructions to give them the best results.

Informing them as to costs and time frame.

Ongoing client relations.

While the above subjects give a basic training that will allow the registered land surveyor to practise effectively in a wide range of work; there are a number of other subjects which will either allow more efficient work in some situations or will allow specialised or unusual jobs to be carried out.

It is recommended that some such subjects be covered by each candidate - and credit will be given for such subjects.

6.

Level Of  Supervision6.LEVEL OF SUPERVISION

The surveyor is solely responsible for surveys carried out under his/her supervision, and all surveyors should exercise a standard of supervision that will ensure that surveys reflects their professional responsibilities and comply with relevant statutes.

The extent of supervision will vary according to the experience and skill and ethics of the candidate.

The recommended level of supervision is as follows:-

6.1		The supervisor should fully brief the candidate on the purpose and details of the survey before the candidate commences involvement in that survey,

6.2		The supervisor should discuss all aspects of the survey with the candidate at the completion of the work,

6.3		Early in the training period the supervising surveyor should always accompany the candidate on site, until the candidate demonstrates an ability to act as team leader for some parts of the survey.

From that time onwards the frequency of on site supervision can be reduced, but-
?

the supervisor should be present on sufficient occasions during each survey to ensure that the candidate's problems are solved expeditiously,
?

the supervisor should inspect the marking and physical aspects of the survey, and the field records, closes, re-establishment etc on its completion, and
?

the supervisor should effect sufficient angular and linear checks of the surveys to be satisfied with the standard and accuracy of the candidate's work.

6.4		Just before the successful completion of the training agreement it is acceptable for the supervision of the candidate to be reduced for the specific purpose of the further professional development of the candidate's work attitude and ethics.

6.5		If the supervising surveyor wishes to lessen supervision (under guideline 6.4), the supervisor should advise the Board in writing that the candidate is within three months of sitting final examinations and will be receiving only off-site supervision.

6.6		The supervising surveyor will still be wholly responsible for the correctness of the surveys.

6.7		It is recommended that in the period of off-site supervision:-
?

in the cases of simple jobs, the supervising surveyor should inspect the field record of each job, and
?

in other cases the candidate should prepare a short survey report describing important aspects of each survey (particularly the re-establishment) and
?

that this record be retained by the supervising surveyor and forms part of the off-site supervision.

These reports could form part of the documentation presented to the Board supporting the candidate's application for registration as a land surveyor.

6.8		Acceptance of only off-site supervision is limited to the final period of a candidate's training.

It is never to be extended to a person who is not under a training agreement, no matter how extensive that person's experience.

6.9		Supervisors should act within the confines and the spirit of the certificate signed in each fieldbook (namely, "under my own personal supervision, inspection and field check") lodged during the period of a Professional Training Agreement.

The fact that the supervisor has signed the plan and fieldbook indicates satisfaction as to the accuracy of the survey, that the survey is in accordance with the regulations, and an acceptance of full responsibility for the survey.

7.

Responsibilities Of The Supervisor

The professional training of a candidate is an important and demanding role, not one to be undertaken lightly or for the wrong reasons.

The responsibilities of the surveyor include,:-

7.1	to provide the range of experience necessary for the candidate's development,
7.2	to provide the tuition and guidance necessary for the candidate's development (both technical and professional),
7.3	to be wholly responsible for the correct performance of jobs by the candidate,
7.4	to treat the candidate's development as of primary importance and not just an ancillary activity to the running of the firm or the correct completion of surveys,
7.5	to encourage the candidate's participation in continuing professional development courses.

(Refer to guideline 9).

7.8	to be responsible for the decision to put the candidate forward for examination.

The Board must depend heavily on the surveyor's opinion as to the candidate's readiness,
 	
The Professional Training Agreement should state the extent of the supervisor's responsibility (if any is accepted) for arranging or participating in training (of a stated nature) that is not available within the supervisor's firm.

To clarify the extent or basis of the agreement it is beneficial for it to list the scope of work normally done by the supervisor, and to list any necessary types of work which the supervisor does not do.

It is recognised that the supervisor is not committed to successfully complete the candidate's development within any time frame, even though a time schedule is included in the agreement.

The length of time necessary to complete the training is dependant on the ability and endeavours of the candidate.

8.

Responsibilities of The Candidate

8.1	Fundamental and general educational matters (including familiarity with Acts, regulations, guidelines and manuals) should not be neglected by the candidate.

8.2	The length of elapsed time before accreditation is expected to be heavily dependant on the amount of personal time that the candidate is prepared to contribute during (and before) the Training Agreement.

8.3	The candidate is responsible for ensuring that sufficient time is spent on continuing professional development.

8.4	The candidate is responsible for keeping records of the training received and for informing the supervisor of any slippage of time.

8.5	To clarify the basis for the agreement (and to assist in preparing an achievable time schedule) it is beneficial for the agreement to include a realistic description of the candidate's competencies, experience and knowledge before entering the agreement.

9.

Training Reports

9.1	The following records should be maintained.

The maintenance of these records will help the supervising surveyor and the candidate to identify any deficiencies in the training program, and will assist with the preparation of reports to the Board (Forms 1 and 2 attached).

?

BY THE CANDIDATE:-
-	a work folder of representative completed jobs;
-	a summary assessment of the candidate's own perception of progress with the components undertaken during the period;
-	a personal work diary recording individual jobs that the candidate has been involved with and validating the type of work experience and the accrual of training days; and
-	a record of the professional development courses that have been attended.

?

BY THE SUPERVISING SURVEYOR:-
-	reports covering the level of skill and knowledge of the candidate, such that the degree and complexity of work and responsibilities can be analysed; and
-	verification, comment and signing off of the candidate's work folder and work diary.

Each entry in the records described above in this paragraph should specifically state which of the skills listed in guideline 5 have been developed during that job.

9.2	Each supervisor who has undertaken in-full or in-part a component of a candidate's training is required to document the categories of training and the period during which it was undertaken.

A certificate (Form 1) to that effect is required to be signed after each period.

9.3	The period and categories of training must aggregate to at least the minimum requirement set out in the Board approved agreement.

See Form 1 attached.

9.5	The Board will monitor the progress through the reports, and where necessary provide counselling and assistance to ensure appropriate training opportunities are provided to the candidate and support is available to the Supervising Surveyor.

10.

Statutory Declaration11.STATUTORY DECLARATION

A statutory declaration is required to be signed by the supervisor in the agreement, testifying that in his/her opinion, the candidate is capable of successfully progressing to examination and operating as a registered land surveyor in their own right.

See Form 2)

11.

The Examination

11.1	Examination Timing
	The supervisor decides when a candidate has the all-round skills and knowledge to result in a successful completion of the Board's examination.

There will always be personal and commercial pressures that may influence the timing of that decision.

The focus must however always be on the capability of the candidate to perform as a registed surveyor in their own right.

11.2	Certification Of Project Work
	The candidate must certify that the examination projects are their own work.

Refer to schedule 3 of the Regulations and the Guidelines for Candidates ....for more information.

11.3		Equipment
	The supervisor should ensure that the candidate is given the best possible support to ensure a successful result at the Board's examination.

This should include appropriate access to equipment and staff for examination surveys.

11.4	Examination Preparation
	The supervising surveyor should consider work allocation when the candidate is undertaking surveys for examination, to ensure the candidate has adequate time and opportunitiy.

12.

Transfer Of An Agreement

	If circumstances arise such that the candidate's training cannot be optimally managed by the supervising surveyor, then the supervising surveyor should arrange transfer of the professional training agreement, or in extreme cases its suspension or termination.

This should be undertaken in consultation with the Board.

13.

Dispute Resolution13.DISPUTE RESOLUTION

		If the aspirations and commitments of both parties are discussed during the shared preparation of the agreement, and if the candidate's progress is discussed frequently during the period of the agreement, a dispute is unlikely.

If a dispute arises that cannot be readily resolved by the supervisor and candidate, the Board will willingly provide a Board member to assist with negotiations or resolution.

Such assistance will not infer blame.

14.

Termination Of Agreement

		It is prudent for both parties to include in the Professional Training Agreement a clause that outlines the circumstances and conditions relating to the termination of the agreement.

The Board suggests that the provisions of paragraphs 13 & 14 above be fully considered before implementing such termination.

The Board must be notified of the termination of an agreement.

The notification should include evidence that both parties concur with the termination.

The Board should be provided with a Certificate of Service for its records.

FORM 1
SURVEYORS ACT 2002
Surveyors Regulations 2003
STATEMENT OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Use this form to record and submit to the Tasmanian Land Surveyors Accreditation Board evidence of the candidate's professional experience during the period of the Professional Training Agreement.

This Agreement is made in the following context:
A.

The Commonwealth, State and Territory Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) Agreement provides a framework that guides and strengthens the relationship between the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments to:
 provide transitional supported accommodation and related support services, in order to help people who are homeless to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence.

B.

This Agreement contributes to responses to homelessness.

It is made under the provisions of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994 (Commonwealth) and has been jointly developed by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.

The parties to this Agreement have a shared interest in improving outcomes for people who are homeless and those at risk of homelessness, including people experiencing domestic violence.

C. The Commonwealth, States and Territories acknowledge that homelessness is a complex problem that requires a flexible range of responses across the breadth of the human service delivery system.

The Supported Accommodation Assistance Program is an important part of the continuum of the Australian effort towards preventing and responding to homelessness and domestic violence.

D. This Agreement is the fifth in a series of agreements between the parties.

Arrangements over the next five years will enhance program development, further promote service quality and optimise client outcomes.

E. SAAP relies on agreed funding and is cooperatively managed at the national level between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories.

Delivery is primarily by non-government service providers with some local government participation.

F. The parties wish to continue to build a robust program that consolidates and builds on the strengths of SAAP over the past twenty years.

The Commonwealth Government in cooperation with the governments of the States and Territories have agreed to focus on three Strategic Priorities over the life of this SAAP V Agreement.

These are: 
a. increase involvement in early intervention and prevention strategies;
b. provide better assistance to people who have a number of support needs; and
c. provide ongoing assistance to ensure stability for clients post crisis.

G. In working towards these priorities the parties recognise the vulnerability of people who are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness, including those with a high level of support needs.

H. The parties also recognise the dignity of people who are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness and commit to provide support and opportunities to increase their independence and self-reliance and maximise their participation in community life.

I.

This Agreement is primarily about responsibilities, financial arrangements and the accountability framework for the fifth SAAP Agreement (SAAP V).

3.2.

Strategic Priorities for SAAP V
3.2.1.

The parties wish to continue to build a robust program that consolidates and builds on the strengths of SAAP over the past twenty years.

Through SAAP, the Commonwealth in cooperation with the States and Territories have agreed to focus on three Strategic Priorities over the life of this SAAP V Agreement.

These are to:
a. increase involvement in early intervention and prevention strategies;
b. provide better assistance to people who have a number of support needs; and
c. provide ongoing assistance to ensure stability for clients post-crisis.

3.3.

Principles for implementation of SAAP V
3.3.1.

The principles adopted by the parties for implementation of SAAP V are:
a.

Shared commitment
Commitment for SAAP is shared between the Commonwealth and all State and Territory governments.

It relies on agreed funding, a shared commitment to performance monitoring and evaluation, and a shared commitment to collaboration between parties.

b.

Cultural appropriateness 
SAAP services are inclusive and recognise that the characteristics of homelessness vary between cultural groups.

SAAP services will be appropriate in their design, delivery and promotion to the needs of Indigenous people and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and where appropriate, delivered with the assistance of an interpreter in a language in which the client is competent in.

c. Service responsiveness and flexibility
SAAP services are sensitive to the range of needs of the client.

Appropriate client-focussed responses are delivered as soon as practicable, and case management ensures that changing needs are met.

Services are able to establish and maintain linkages to assist in resolving client needs, including reconnection with family and social networks and with employment, housing, education and income support to help with longer term stabilisation.

d. Service accessibility
SAAP services are accessible to all clients, and there are no barriers to access - for example due to an inability to pay.

Services are able to meet the special needs of specific client groups, and there are no discriminatory practices or policies.

e. Client rights and dignities protected and promoted
The SAAP service system supports effective client charters and provides access to appropriate avenues of dispute resolution.

f. Client independence and resilience maximised 
SAAP service delivery is aimed at maximising the client's capacity for independence and resilience, by establishing appropriate connections with the range of social and economic supports and enhancing the opportunities for participation.

These include reconnection with family and social networks and with employment, housing, education and income support to help with longer term stabilisation.

g. A service system that is efficient and effective
Within available resources the SAAP service system is robust and sustainable, and is able to reform to meet emerging and changing needs without jeopardising existing system successes.

3.3.2.

The parties will develop SAAP in collaboration with community partners and use their best endeavours to meet nationally agreed objectives and performance indicators as set out in this Agreement.

The final amount of the sanction, up to the maximum allowed, will be determined at the discretion of the Commonwealth Minister.

8.2.4.

The maximum sanction applied in respect of failure by a State or Territory is:
a. four percent of Commonwealth program funding for failure as described in clause 8.2.2.a;
b. one percent of Commonwealth program funding for failure as described in clause 8.2.2.b; and
c. five percent of Commonwealth program funding for failure as described in clause 8.2.2.c.

States and Territories will be notified if any sanctions are to be applied.

8.3.

Exemptions
8.3.1.

Exemptions may be granted to States and Territories regarding late submissions of reports or information required under this Agreement, only when an explanation and request for extension is provided by notice to the Commonwealth with reasonable time for consideration by the Commonwealth Minister.

Exemptions will be granted at the Commonwealth Minister's discretion.

8.4.

Redistribution
8.4.1.

Surplus funds that become available due to the enforcement of sanctions will, at the Commonwealth Minister's discretion, be offered to other States and Territories on a matching basis.

Redistribution will be at the Commonwealth Minister's discretion.

8.5.

Indexation arrangements
8.5.1.

Indexation on Commonwealth funds to be transferred to States and Territories will be calculated each Year by reference to the Commonwealth indexation parameter called Wage Cost Index 1 and announced in the Commonwealth Budget.

This parameter is currently composed of 75% measure of the change in wage costs (safety net adjustment) and 25% measure of changes in non-wage costs (Treasury measure underlying Inflation).

8.5.2.

When calculating the Commonwealth's contribution for the next Year, the previous Year's base funding will be adjusted so that the indexation component is calculated using the actual value (rather that the estimate) of the WCI 1 for that Year.

This adjusted base funding will form the basis of the next Year's base funding.

8.5.3.

States and Territories will advise the Commonwealth of the level of indexation of their funding under this Agreement which is to be, at a minimum, the same or higher than the Commonwealth's level of indexation.

8.6.

Uncommitted funds at 30 June
8.6.1.

All SAAP funds which are uncommitted funds at 30 June of each Year will, subject to the agreement of the Ministers for the parties involved, be either made available for SAAP funding by those parties in the following Year or recovered by the Commonwealth and the State and Territory on the ratio of their respective total funding liability to the program as at 30 June of that Year.

8.7.

Repayment of funding assistance and rollover of funds
8.7.1.

Where Commonwealth funding assistance provided to a State and Territory under this Agreement remains uncommitted at the end of this Agreement, the relevant State and Territory will repay to the Commonwealth so much of that amount as the Commonwealth Minister advises in writing to the Minister of the State and Territory.

Alternatively, a rollover of funds to the following Year where SAAP continues may be agreed at the discretion of the Commonwealth Minister.

8.7.2.

Where in the reasonable opinion of the Commonwealth, funding assistance provided under this Agreement to a State or Territory has been spent other than for the purposes of this Agreement, that State or Territory must repay to the Commonwealth so much of that amount as the Commonwealth Minister advises in writing to the Minister of the State or Territory.

8.8.

Financial Statement including Certificate of Compliance
8.8.1.

The Minister of each State and Territory will provide to the Commonwealth Minister by 31 October following the end of a Year, or such later date as is jointly agreed by the Ministers for the parties involved, a statement of receipts and expenditure including certification that the funding provided under this Agreement and the contribution from the State and Territory, was made and expended in accordance with the Agreement.

This statement will be in the form at Attachment 1 of Schedule 2.

8.9.

Funds for program administration
8.9.1.

The States and Territories may use, for the administration of the program, the same recurrent dollar amount, indexed annually at the same rate as determined under clause 8.5, as each was entitled to use under SAAP IV for the 2004-2005 financial year.

Any additional requirement for administrative funds by a State and Territory must be agreed by the Commonwealth Minister and the relevant State or Territory Minister.

ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK
Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) V Accountability Framework

The SAAP V Accountability Framework is a dynamic multilayered set of accounting and reporting requirements incorporating both national and state levels of accountability.

National accountability requirements are documented in this Agreement with State and Territory accountability requirements documented in their respective Bilateral Agreements.

A key component of the SAAP V Accountability Framework is a set of performance measures at both the National and jurisdictional level, designed to determine whether SAAP program outcomes are being achieved.

Commonwealth, State and Territory Government officials have worked together to develop the SAAP V Accountability Framework.

The SAAP V Accountability Framework was derived from a program logic approach (Attachment A).

Reporting informs all levels of government and the public about how well SAAP V outcomes are being met and how much these outcomes are costing the taxpayers1.

National and State and Territory reporting is required at management, performance and Strategic Priorities level.

The following table provides a description of each of the three streams of accountability:

Management ReportingNational reporting against key administrative indicators of the program, including jurisdictional financial and organisational performance, and performance against the SAAP V Principles.

Performance ReportingMeasurements are developed jointly and use a range of information collected from Service Providers with States and Territories to report against a comprehensive set of performance indicators, including identified client outcomes within the SAAP V Program Logic.

Strategic PrioritiesKey performance information reported jurisdictionally, as outlined in the Bilateral Agreements, monitoring State and Territory progress against the SAAP V Strategic Priorities.

The Accountability Framework encompasses three basic perspectives through which SAAP V program performance is viewed:
* Equity - the extent to which the service provided by the program is accessed by all targeted clients, including those belonging to minority groups;
* Efficiency - the measurement of whether outcomes are achieved in the most cost efficient manner; and
* Effectiveness - the measurement of results, impacts and accomplishments achieved by the program, comprising three further elements:
o Client outcomes - the extent to which the intended impacts of the service on clients are achieved as elaborated by the SAAP Program Logic;
o Appropriateness - the extent that the service is client-focussed and meets clients' needs; and
o Quality - the extent to which clients are satisfied with the service provided and the extent to which service meets specified quality standards.

The following table identifies the national performance indicators to be reported during SAAP V. Performance indicators that can be measured from the commencement date of SAAP V are specified.

Other Performance indicators require development during the life of SAAP V.

Administrative Data Set
The Administrative Data Set will contain a comprehensive range of data items about each Service Provider funded through SAAP, including:
* Service Provider name;
* contact details (postal address, email address, contact person);
* funding level;
* target group; and
* Service Provider type.

Data items and prescribed format of reporting will be agreed by all parties to the Agreement within three months of the commencement of this Agreement and may be varied by agreement of all parties at any time during the life of the Agreement.

States and Territories will report Administrative Data to the National Data Collection Agency twice a year in the prescribed format.

The first report will be provided no later than 15 January and the second no later than 15 July each year of the Agreement.

Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) V Program Logic

Preamble


The SAAP V Program Logic forms part of the broader SAAP V Accountability Framework.

It is a tool that identifies a chain of reasoning and links program inputs3, processes4, outputs 5and outcomes6.

The Program Logic map is a graphic representation of the way SAAP V operates, in that it shows the presumed effects of activities and resources.

The Program Logic can be useful for a number of purposes, including informing Program design, planning, risk assessment, performance monitoring and evaluation.

It should be noted that the SAAP V Program Logic hierarchy describes the primary linkages between program interventions and client outcomes only.

It is acknowledged that a multitude of secondary interconnections within SAAP exist and that achievement of many of the identified outcomes in the Program Logic will be influenced by factors outside the control of SAAP.

Furthermore, it is accepted that there are many interactions between SAAP and other service systems within the broader environment, and that the influence of external factors on the SAAP system will be greatest at the higher outcome levels.

Inherent within the SAAP V Program Logic is the acceptance of the Principles and Strategic Priorities underpinning SAAP V.  These include SAAP's key role in the resolution of crisis and the provision of a safety net for homeless people, those at risk of homelessness, and people affected by domestic violence as defined by the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994.

4.3	The Developer indemnifies Telstra in respect of any and all loss, damage or expense suffered by Telstra due to a claim concerning infringement of intellectual property rights brought by a third party in relation to Telstra's use of Developer Material to install and maintain the Network Infrastructure and to update and maintain Telstra's recording systems.

5.

Ownership of the Network Infrastructure

5.1	Telstra shall own the Network Infrastructure, and any other equipment or facilities installed by Telstra (none of which shall be considered a fixture, notwithstanding that elements of the Network Infrastructure may be fixed to the Land in some way) up to the network boundary point.

- PRICING -

Part E.	How are payments calculated?

E(a)	What fees apply?

(1)	The current fee is $125.80 per annum, until 31 December 2006, for each Entitled Person Client where the date of the approval (either with or without services approved) is completed and meets the payment criteria in the Department's VHC system.

This fee will be adjusted on 01 January 2007 in accordance with Part E(a)(2).

All fees are/will be exclusive of GST.

The Health and Community Care Sector Wage Cost Index used to determine the above, will be the index relevant at the end of each financial year.

Fees may also be amended from time to time outside of indexation arrangements.

Any change to the fees will be at the sole discretion of DVA.

The payments of all fees will be made consistent with Part E(c)[Claim for payment] and clause 3 of this Agreement.

E(b)	What expenses can be reimbursed?

E(c)	What claiming issues arise?

Only one completed assessment and approval per Entitled Person per year will be paid for, regardless of the number of assessments and/or amended approvals, or whether an Person Client transfers from region to region, or whether the Contractor for a region changes.

This registration will occur as the result, of a completed assessment and approval, after their details have been entered onto the VHC system by the Contractor.

Assessments without a completed approval will not be paid for.

This situation also applies where the Entitled Person has been approved for no services.

The anniversary payment will be paid at the rate applicable on the anniversary date.

In the situation where the assessment agency in a region changes, then the assessment agency that is 'active' in the region on the day that the anniversary  assessment becomes eligible to be paid, will receive the anniversary payment.

At least once a month the Department's VHC system will calculate how many approvals have been completed by the Contractor in the previous payment period (or how many anniversary  payments fall in the previous month) meet the payment criteria.

All accounts will be then processed using the existing Department's payment system to ensure prompt and accurate results.

The Contractor will be paid at least once a month, in the second week of the month for assessments completed in the previous month, except in circumstances where technical difficulties occur.

(4)	As outlined above, saving a completed assessment in the Department's VHC system constitutes a claim for payment.

Note, the following appears at the top of the assessment screen:

This report also constitutes a claim for payment.

Giving false or misleading information is a serious offence.

(5)	The Contractor will be issued with a monthly report listing assessments paid for.

E(d)	Do incentives, discounts or conditions apply?

Relates to clause 4 [Incentives and discounts].

(1)	There are no incentives or discounts like those referred to in clause 4 [Incentives and discounts].

Part J.

What is this Agreement's formal status?

J(a)	Is this Agreement a contract, standing offer, deed, non-binding etc?

(1)	This Agreement forms a standing offer under which specific contract for services (or supplies) may be accepted by DVA, through the following process.

(2)	An Entitled Person, their representative or health professional will contact the Contractor to request that an Entitled Person be recorded as a VHC client for that region and have services arranged by the Contractor.

The Contractor shall undertake an assessment of the Entitled Person and  transfer information about that Entitled Person's service usage into the Department's VHC system.

Once an assessment is complete then a discrete contract has been formed between DVA and the Contractor.

Each discrete contract shall be subject to and incorporate the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(3)	DVA shall not be liable for any work which the ordering officer has not requested in writing through the issue of a Service Plan.

(4)	DVA does not bind itself to any exclusive arrangement, to order any specific quantities of the Services or to engage any quantity at all, but reserves the right to engage such quantity of the Services as may be required during the period of this Agreement, according to the requirements of DVA.

J(b)	What is this Agreement's context and how are amendments managed?

DVA undertakes to use its best endeavours to notify the contractor of amendments to the Guidelines (Attachment '1') in advance of those amendments taking effect.

Deferred Forest Agreement between the Commonwealth and NSW
Preamble 
WHEREAS the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of New South Wales wish to protect forest areas which may be required for a national forest reserve system, in keeping with commitments made in the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS), pending the negotiation of Regional Forest Agreements, the following is agreed: 
Interpretation 
1.

In this Agreement, unless otherwise specified: 
"The Governments" means the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of New South Wales; and 
"Agreement Area" means the area composed of the 32 management areas defined in Clause 7 below.

"Deferred Forest Area" means all those public native forests within the Agreement Area which are not otherwise listed as available for harvesting in the New South Wales State Forests' Logging Schedule 1995-96 (Attachment 1) as amended in accordance with this Agreement, but does not include plantations; 
"Commercial timber harvesting" means harvesting for sawlogs, pulpwood, veneer logs, poles, piles, girders and sleepers or associated roading activities.

1.1.

The provisions of this Agreement are not intended to give rise to legally enforceable rights or obligations between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales.

1.2.

Unless otherwise specified, this Agreement shall apply only to publicly owned native forests within the Agreement Area which are outside of existing reserves and which are not plantations.

1.3.

The Commonwealth and New South Wales recognise that this Agreement and any RFA negotiated cannot impose on a party any obligation that is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth or of New South Wales where that law is binding upon that party.

Permissible activities 
2.

The State of New South Wales may permit commercial timber harvesting operations to take place only in those public native forest areas which are listed as available for harvesting in Attachment 1 as amended in accordance with this Agreement.

3.

Deferred Forest Areas have been identified after consideration of the officials' report on the Deferred Forest Assessment (DFA) process, and related reports including those of the Comonwealth Scientific Advisory Group.

The Deferred Forest Areas are intended to ensure that the parties have available to them the broadest responsible range of reserve selection and design options for identification, through the RFA process, of areas required for a CAR reserve system in accordance with the process related to the Commonwealth's reserve criteria of July 1995 (Attachment 2).

4.

In order to protect the values identified in the Deferred Forest Area assessment, the State of New South Wales shall not permit commercial timber harvesting operations to take place in Deferred Forest Areas.

5.

Clause 4 does not prevent the completion of commercial timber harvesting operations, in areas previously approved by the Commonwealth, where operations commenced prior to this Agreement coming into force, and where that approval has not been withdrawn prior to this Agreement coming into force, subject to case by case reference to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that they are in the Deferred Forest Area.

6.

The State of New South Wales may permit other activities, including mining, mineral exploration, minor forest products getting, grazing, beekeeping and recreational activities, in Deferred Forest Areas subject to the normal provisions of any applicable Commonwealth and State legislation, including environmental protection legislation.

Agreement Area 
7.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the Agreement Area for New South Wales is comprised of the 32 management areas listed in Schedule 2 as defined at the date of signature of this Agreement, and as modified by the boundaries of the four Deferred Forest Assessment Study Areas shown on the attached map (Schedule 3).

Duration 
8.

The Agreement commences from the date of signature by both Governments and remains in force until 31 December 1999, subject to Clauses 9 and 20-23.

9.

Where a Regional Forest Agreement applies to an area covered by this Agreement, the terms of the Regional Forest Agreement will override the provisions of this Agreement in respect of that area.

10.

Any variation to this Agreement must be agreed in writing by the Governments and added to the Agreement by way of attachment.

Exceptional circumstances - review 
11.

12.

Any proposed change, including under Clause 11, to the status of part of the Agreement area shall be not be made unless the agreed values would continue to be protected.

13.

Consideration may also be given during the review process to the designation of new areas available for timber harvesting from areas in the Deferred Forest Area, or vice versa, where these are required to replace areas for any of the reasons specified above.

14.

The review process shall be initiated by agreement of the Governments and shall include a public consultation process with a period for interested parties to comment on any significant proposed change to the status of part of the Agreement area.

14.1.

The Governments may, where circumstances dictate the need for urgent review of an area covered under this Agreement, agree that the review process shall not include an opportunity for public comment and that a decision will be made expeditiously.

15.

The Governments shall not unreasonably withhold agreement to review or redefine the status of an area or areas covered by this Agreement and any such change must not prejudice the opportunity of setting up a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for the agreed values, as assessed in the DFA.

Information and standards of assessment 
16.

The Governments shall make available to each other any and all information which may have bearing on the conduct of a review subject to commercial and other confidentiality, copyright or contractual arrangements.

17.

17.1.

In relation to such reviews, the Commonwealth shall allow for differences in the obligations to apply to each State only to the extent necessary to take account of differences in the forest types and in the environmental, economic and social factors in each State and differences in the level, quality and analysis of information about forest regions .

New South Wales Interim Assessment Process 
18.

The Governments of New South Wales and the Commonwealth agree to participate in a joint assessment of high conservation value forests for interim protection in New South Wales through the existing New South Wales Interim Assessment process conducted by the Resource and Conservation Assessment Council (RACAC).

19.

The Commonwealth recognises the Interim Assessment process and will participate as a member of RACAC in that process.

The RACAC will take into account the Commonwealth's comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve criteria and consider the policy objectives of the New South Wales Government in making its assessment.

19.1.

The New South Wales Interim Assessment process will consider, inter alia, the Buccleuch and Bago-Maragle State Forests of NSW Management Areas.

Review of Areas following New South Wales Interim Assessment Process 
20.

Following completion of the New South Wales Interim Assessment Process the Governments shall review the status of areas covered by this Agreement and shall consider whether any area should be added to or removed from the Agreement Area (including the Buccleuch and Bago-Maragle State Forests of NSW Management Areas).

21.

The review under Clause 20 shall have regard to the findings and recommendations of the New South Wales Interim Assessment Process.

22.

23.

Commitments 
24.

The Governments agree to abide by the commitments set out in Schedule 1 of this Agreement and the Scoping Agreement for New South Wales, being an Agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales which sets out the methodology to be undertaken to reach one or more Regional Forest Agreements.

1.

Where the area of a land type is specified in Column 4 of tables G1a, G2, and G3 of the Deferred Forest Areas Report for New South Wales, the New South Wales Government agrees that it will protect from harvesting within the area available for harvesting such areas of that land type as in total would equal the area specified in Column 4.

2.

The New South Wales Government will monitor compliance with the prescriptions and conditions of timber harvesting licences to ensure, so far as reasonably possible, that the forest conservation values which the Deferred Forest Areas report indicates will be protected are so protected.

3.

The Eden Native Forest Management Area will be included in the New South Wales Government's Interim Forest Assessment Process.

4.

The New South Wales Interim Forest Assessment Process will include a broad-scale survey of old growth forest on public lands.

The results of this survey will be considered in the review conducted under Clauses 20-23 of this Agreement to improve the classification and protection of old growth forest in NSW.

5.

This Agreement is not intended to affect any right which a Visiting Medical Officer covered by this Agreement and Eastern Health may have apart from this Agreement.

8.

CLASSIFICATIONS 
Specialist
Specialist means a doctor who possesses a higher qualification appropriate to the speciality in which they are employed or has sufficient experience in their specialty to satisfy Eastern Health that the appointment is warranted.

Visiting Medical Officer (VMO)
Visiting Medical Officer (VMO) means a specialist who is paid by Eastern Health on an hourly basis and is NOT a full time specialist  or a Hospital Medical Officer.

Senior specialist
Senior specialist means a doctor who in addition to the qualifications for a specialist role has:
* Not less than 3 years practical experience in that specialty after obtaining the higher qualification; or
* Sufficient experience in the specialities to satisfy Eastern Health that the appointment is warranted.

Where the doctor has a first specialist qualification and is undergoing further specialist training, the time spent since acquiring their first specialist qualification shall be counted as experience within this and any higher classification.

Principal Specialist
Principal specialist means a doctor appointed as such by Eastern Health.

In addition to the qualifications for a specialists role, they must have:
* Not less than nine years' practical experience in that specialty after obtaining higher qualification; or
* Sufficient experience in the specialties to satisfy Eastern Health that the appointment is warranted.

A doctor appointed as a head of department in a teaching hospital Group 1A or Group 1B will be paid no less than a principal specialist level 2.

Where the doctor has a first specialist qualification and is undergoing further specialist training, the time spent since acquiring their first specialist qualification shall be counted as experience within this and any higher classification.

Executive specialist
Executive specialist means a doctor appointed as such by Eastern Health.

An executive specialist is required to exercise professional leadership and/or management accountability which is clearly outside of the responsibilities of a principal specialist level 2.

The examples of such responsibility could include:
* Responsibility over a range of units/departments
* Direct supervision of a number of principal specialists level 2
* Being required to serve on the executive management team of Eastern Health
* Demonstrated leadership in the activities of a significant national and/or international learned College or Society within their discipline
* Executive specialists roles will only be utilised in major teaching Hospitals where the organisational structure contains such a role and a suitable candidate is available to fill it.

The remuneration rates as at 1 January 2005 are set out in Clause 24.

10.

SALARY PACKAGING
Employees are permitted to salary package in accordance with Eastern Health policy as amended from time to time.

Eastern Health and AMA/ASMOF will jointly approach providers of salary packaging services to ensure improved service provision salary packaging to employees covered by this Agreement.

The remuneration specified in this Agreement can be packaged and taken as a combination of salary and benefits up to the legislative limit specified in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) subject to the VMO paying normal administrative costs.

If changes to legislation result in the cost of this arrangement to Eastern Health increasing, then any continuation of a salary packaging arrangement will be dependant on the participating VMO meeting any additional costs, including taxation or fringe benefits, associated with such changes.

11.

PHYSICAL WORKING CONDITIONS
It is agreed that the following infrastructure standards are ideal:
* Access to work stations, telecommunication and information technology capable of ensuring administrative and similar work can be accomplished efficiently;
* 24 hour access to library and all of its resources;
* Reserved car parking paid for by Eastern Health and available for a doctor on call and recalled.

Parking spaces must be well lit and in a secure place within 200 meters from the front door of the Hospital's main entrance.

Nothing in this clause affects Eastern Health's arrangements for car parking for which the doctor pays when he/she is not on call and recalled;
* Access to internet and email facilities for work purposes;
* Space available for private discussion with patient's relatives;
* Access to security escort late at night.

Where this is currently not the case, Eastern Health, DHS and the AMA/ASMOF will consult to discuss how quickly the situation can be remedied within available capital funding budgets.

12.

13.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
Where the parties fail to agree upon some issue, matter or thing, the subject of this Agreement, they shall follow these procedures:
Framework for resolution 
The parties intend that most workplace issues will be resolved informally between a VMO and the medical VMO's immediate supervisor.

The parties agree that they will promptly resolve any workplace issue by informal conciliation without resort to industrial action of any kind by a VMO or stand downs by Eastern Health.

Every effort will be made to ensure that any workplace dispute will be resolved within 7 days or as close to 7 days as practical circumstances will allow.

This timeframe includes disputes relating to the work required, overtime and un-rostered hours and the appropriate rate of payment as specified in the Agreement.

Until the dispute is resolved, work shall continue normally while discussions take place.

Health and safety matters may be exempted where appropriate.

No party is prejudiced as to final settlement of the dispute by continuing to work during the dispute.

Process for resolving disputes over the application of this Agreement:
Where a particular dispute that arises is one over the application of this Agreement (in accordance with s170LW of the Act) the following process shall apply:

The VMO shall attempt to resolve the dispute directly with their Department head.

The VMO and/or the Department head may request the presence of another member of staff or representative to represent their interests.

If the matter is still unresolved it shall be referred to the Director of Medical Services (or equivalent) who will meet with the VMO and, if the VMO chooses, an Association representative or any other person.

If parties are still unable to reach a resolution about matters concerning the application of this Agreement, the matter shall be referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for resolution and, if necessary, arbitration, pursuant to section 170LW of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.

14.

At Eastern Health Service's election, it can pay the VMO salary in lieu of the notice or give a combination of notice and payment in lieu of notice.

In the exercise of any of its powers in relation to the termination of employment of the VMO, Eastern Health shall make due enquiry, apply the principles of natural justice and comply with all applicable laws of the State of Victoria, including the provisions of the Health Services Act 1988.

If the VMO's appointment to Eastern Health's medical staff has terminated, he/she may not provide medical services at Eastern Health campuses to Hospital Patients, Private Patients or Compensable Patients.

15.

For females, maternity leave may be taken and for males, paternity leave may be taken.

Parental leave is unpaid leave except that VMOs will be entitled to 6 weeks paid maternity leave as part of their 52 weeks total maternity leave or one week's paid paternity leave (as applicable).

Adoption leave may be taken in the case of adoption.

The aggregate of paid sick leave, maternity leave and parental leave, including parental leave taken by a spouse, may not exceed 52 weeks.

An employee may commence adoption leave prior to providing such notice, where through circumstances beyond the control of the employee, the adoption of a child takes place earlier.

The employee and the employer should agree on the length of the unpaid leave.

Where agreement cannot be reached, the employee is entitled to take up to two days unpaid leave.

Where paid leave is available to the employee, the employer may require the employee to take such leave instead.

Any such change to be notified at least four weeks prior to the commencement of the changed arrangements.

In the case of an employee transferred to a safe job pursuant to 15.8, the employee will be entitled to return to the position they held immediately before such transfer.

16.

SABBATICAL LEAVE 
(i)	Sabbatical leave entitlements are granted to benefit Eastern Health Service as well as the Practitioner.

It is not expected that the Practitioner will resign or retire within 2 years of taking their sabbatical leave entitlement.

In calculating such aggregate of service any period of employment in any of the Eastern Health Service hospitals of less than six continuous months' duration will be disregarded.

Service will be deemed continuous despite any period between an appointment with one Eastern Health Service hospital and another (excluding all periods of paid annual, long service or sick leave) of five weeks or less, but it will be necessary for a Practitioner as part of his/her qualification for any sabbatical leave entitlement, to serve such additional period as equals the period between appointments.

The onus of proving a sufficient aggregate of service to support a claim of any sabbatical leave entitlement will at all times rest with the Practitioner concerned.

Unless Eastern Health Service in its absolute discretion agrees otherwise, if the Practitioner applies for or takes less than twenty-six weeks in one allotment or less than two thirteen week allotments of sabbatical leave which are taken within two years of each other he/she shall be deemed to have received the full entitlement under this Clause and shall not be entitled to any of the balance of his/her entitlement.

Eastern Health Service guidelines for approval of projects will be available on request.

The sabbatical leave to which a Practitioner is entitled will be given as soon as practicable having regard to the needs of the hospital but the taking of such leave may be postponed to such date as is mutually agreed.

(vi)	Where Eastern Health does not approve the practitioner's programme of study or research within three months of the written application and details, the practitioner may request that his/her application be referred to the Medical Appointments Committee (however titled) of the Health Service.

The Health Service and the practitioner shall comply with the written advice of the Medical Appointments Committee except that it may be varied by mutual agreement between the Health Service and the practitioner.

17.

In calculating such aggregate of service any period of employment in any of the said hospitals of less than six continuous months' duration will be disregarded.

Service will be deemed continuous despite any period between an appointment with one hospital and another (excluding all periods of paid annual, long service or sick leave) of five weeks or less but it will be necessary for a Practitioner as part of his/her qualification for any long service leave entitlement, to service such additional period as equals the period between appointments.

Service, for the purpose of accrual of long service leave, will be deemed to be continuous despite any service worked as a Doctor outside of the scope of the MECA (the Australian Medical Association (Victoria) Limited, Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation Victorian Branch, Victorian Public Hospital Sector (Hospital Medical Officers) Multi-Employer Certified Agreement 2002) but in a College auspiced specialists training program.

Service also includes all periods during which a practitioner was serving in Her Majesty's Forces or was made available by the employer for National Duty.

(ii)	The onus of proving a sufficient aggregate of service support to claim of any long service leave entitlement will at all times rest with the Practitioner concerned.

(iii)	The long service leave to which a Practitioner is entitled will be given as soon as practicable having regard to the needs of the hospital but the taking of such leave may be postponed to such date as is mutually agreed.

Upon the death of a Practitioner whilst on long service leave, the Hospital will pay to the personal representative of the deceased Practitioner a sum equal to the amount which would have been payable to the Practitioner had he/she retired immediately prior to his/her taking such leave less any amount already paid to the Practitioner in respect of such leave.

(c)	A Practitioner who has completed at least ten years' service but less than fifteen years' service with a hospital or hospitals and whose appointment expires or is terminated by the Practitioner or by Eastern Health Service for any cause other than serious misconduct will be entitled to receive such amount of long service leave as equals one-thirtieth of the period of continuous service.

(d)	For the purpose of determining the entitlements of any Practitioner under any provision of this Clause in respect of a period of employment beginning 31 December 1964 and ending after that date, so much of that service as was completed before that date will be reduced by one quarter.

(e)	The basis of any long service leave payment will be at the average of the ordinary hours of work applying over the preceding 2 years of employment at the rate applicable at the time long service leave is taken, or payment may be made in lieu.

(f)	For the purposes of determining hospital service for long service leave purposes, service with recognised institutions under the Health Services Act (1988), Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute and Department of Human Services Victoria will be included.

VMOs may apply for temporary variation in the number of hours allocated per week during their period of long service leave, providing that such variation will not affect total benefits of entitlements, but enable accrued benefits to be received over a shorter period of time.

Eastern Health at its absolute discretion may agree to such applications and advise the practitioner accordingly in writing.

18.

PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
(i)	A Practitioner will be entitled to be absent without deduction of pay on the days observed as New Years Day, Australia Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Labour Day, Anzac Day, Queen's Birthday, Melbourne Cup Day, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

19.

SICK LEAVE
A Practitioner who becomes unfit for duty due to personal ill-health or injury will be entitled to sick leave for a period or periods not exceeding in aggregate 28 days in any one year.

For three single day absences per year the Practitioner will not be required to provide any supporting evidence to substantiate the claim.

For other days absent due to illness, the hospital may require the Practitioner to provide evidence of illness as follows:

A medical certificate from another Medical Practitioner, but only in circumstances when the certificate may be properly provided;
	OR
A Statutory Declaration, but only for periods of up to 3 consecutive days and only up to 3 occasions in any one year.

(i)	A Practitioner will be paid the remuneration to which he/she would be entitled had he/she attended the ordinary hours of work from which he/she is absent on sick leave.

If the full period of sick leave is not taken during any year of service, such amount as is not taken will be cumulative from year to year.

(ii)	A Practitioner who contracts an infectious disease or suffers any injury arising out of his/her providing services to the hospital will be entitled to have his/her remuneration made up to the remuneration he/she would have received had he/she attended the hours of work from which he/she was absent due to such disease or injury up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks in any one year of service.

This Clause does not impact in any way on a Practitioner's entitlements under the Accident Compensation Act 1985.

(iii)	A Practitioner with responsibilities in relation to members of their immediate family who need their care and support if they are ill, shall be entitled to use up to one week (5 days) per annum from their accrued sick leave to provide care and support.

The Practitioner will, if required, establish by production of a medical certificate or Statutory Declaration, the illness of the person concerned.

20.

COMPASSIONATE/ BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
(a)	A Practitioner shall upon notification to Eastern Health Service be entitled:

(ii)	On the death outside Australia of a wife, husband, mother, father, sister, brother, child or next of kin -
To leave not exceeding two working days without deduction of pay up to and including the day of the funeral of the relative.

Proof of such death or illness shall be furnished by the Practitioner to the satisfaction of Eastern Health Service.

This Clause shall have no operation while the period of entitlement coincides with any other period of leave.

(b)	A Practitioner on compassionate leave shall be paid according to his/her roster or projected roster.

21.

21.2	Annual leave will be taken at a time mutually agreed between the Practitioner and Eastern Health Service.

21.4	Where a Practitioner's appointment is terminated with less than twelve (12) months' service, pro-rata annual leave will be granted or paid in lieu upon termination.

21.5	With the exception of the final year of the contract, all annual leave entitlements will, unless Eastern Health Service otherwise agrees, be taken by the Practitioner within six months of the completion of the twelve (12) months in which the leave is accrued.

22.

Conference leave may be accumulated to a maximum of 4 weeks only.

Whilst on leave the Medical Practitioner shall be paid the in hours fractional remuneration he or she would have received had he or she attended the Hospital during the period of leave.

22.2	The application for conference leave shall be in writing to the Head of Department and shall contain adequate details of the conference or conferences proposed to be attended.

23.

FRACTIONAL ALLOCATION
23.1	Practitioners under this agreement will be employed to work a specified number of hours per week (known as a "fractional allocation") under a fixed term contract of employment.

23.2	The method of fractional allocation for VMOs should be as per the Lochtenberg Implementation Guidelines finalised in 1995 as follows.

23.3	All VMOs, in conjunction with hospital management should determine their hospital workload on a monthly basis.

Activities to be specifically considered are listed below.

Not all areas may be applicable to all specialists.

Direct Public Patient Care and Related Activities
Includes ward rounds, outpatient clinics, pre-operative assessment, operating time, post-operative care, clinical meetings, inter-unitconsultations, completion of operation reports, discharge summaries, casemix information and management of waiting lists.

Management/Administrative Responsibilities
Duties associated with management and/or administration of a unit,  department or division e.g.

roster preparation, budget documents, hospital reports.

Hospital Meetings.

Attendance at meetings constituted by the hospital or at the request of the hospital, including for example:
* When appointed to represent the medical staff on a hospital committee.

* When appointed to represent hospital management on a committee.

* Business or management meetings of a unit/department/division.

* Routinely scheduled meetings with administration.

* Meetings of the medical staff group when related to hospital business.

Participation in Quality Assurance Activities as Required by the Hospital Includes reasonable time directly spent in the collection, analysis and presentation of quality assurance data and attendance at scheduled unit/divisional audit meetings.

Practice in a Distant Location
Only to be included where an allowance is not being paid

23.4	When calculating the actual fraction it will be clear that some aspects of the routine workload occur more frequently than others.

For Instance, meetings may
occur monthly whereas ward rounds may occur daily or a couple of times a week.

Calculations should take account of weekly rosters being transposed on a
      monthly basis.

24.

RATES OF PAY
A Visiting Medical Officer shall be paid the minimum rates as at 1 January 2005 set out below

Class.

It is expected that he/she will be available for oncall duties as rostered by the Health Service at least to the frequency as specified in the employment contract..

Category 1:
Exclusive or urgent call - requiring immediate telephone response to provide advice and to return to the hospital as soon as clinically required, usually within 30 minutes of life threatening emergencies.

Category 1 on-call requires an exclusive commitment by the Practitioner to one hospital.

Category 2:
Non-exclusive call - requiring timely response to provide advice and to return to the hospital as soon as is clinically required, usually within 2 hours.

Schedule 1 - Congress Guidelines

1.

Purpose
The purpose of these Congress Guidelines is to set out in more detail the parties' common understanding of the aims and ideals for the conduct of the Congress.

2.

Objectives for the Congress
World Congresses constitute a vital part of ALARA's work and mission by bringing together practitioners and scholars, participants and inquirers from around the world, joined by a common desire to foster and advance the vision of ALARA:
'that action learning and action research processes are widely used and publicly shared by individuals and groups creating local and global change for the achievement of a more informed, equitable, just, joyful, productive, peaceful and sustainable society.

A key intention is to encourage development across geographic boundaries, professional disciplines and community/organizational contexts, recognizing the common elements of the various strands, streams, settings and variants of action learning, action research and participatory processes.'

The Congress will further foster and advance this vision in principle and practice, and support the broad objectives established for world congresses.

3.

Carbon Neutral Congress
ALARA is committed to delivering a carbon neutral Congress.

In addition to the Host's obligations under clause 4.1, to provide for carbon neutral planning, monitoring and auditing in the Business Plan, ALARA and the Host will use all reasonable endeavours in planning and organising the Congress to achieve this aim, including if necessary the purchase of carbon offsets.

4.

Publication of Congress Papers
ALARA wishes to have the right to publish Congress papers, including any working papers developed during the Congress, in hard copy and by electronic  means.

The Host must ensure that Congress registration forms contain wording by which ALARA is automatically granted an irrevocable, royalty free, world wide licence to publish any papers presented by, or developed during the Congress by each registrant, unless the registrant expressly indicates that it elects not to grant such a licence.

5.

Evaluation and Organisational Learning
The Congress Organising Committee will evaluate its work and provide a written report to the ALARA Management Committee:

The Council, the LGSA, the USU, depa and the LGEA have agreed to resolve disputes concerning industrial matters arising between them about the employment of Council employees, who are members or eligible to be members of the USU and/or depa and/or the LGEA, by allowing such matters to be referred to the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales (the "Commission") as allowed pursuant to the provisions of section 146A of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) (the "Act"), in accordance with the terms of this Referral Agreement.

B.

Where such disputes concerning industrial matters arise the parties agree that they would be assisted in resolving these disputes by the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales.

OPERATIVE PROVISIONS

The parties to this Referral Agreement agree that the following terms, conditions and exclusions apply to such a referral:

For the purposes of this Referral Agreement, an industrial matter has the same meaning as the definition found at section 6 of the Act, but does not include the termination of employment of (or the refusal to employ) any person or class of persons.

2.

This Referral Agreement applies to disputes about industrial matters that occur or arise on or after the date that the Referral Agreement is entered into.

3.

Notwithstanding clause 1, the employment of the general manager or another senior staff member, as defined by section 332 of the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW), or any matter, question or dispute relating to any such employment, is not an industrial matter for the purposes of this Referral Agreement.

4.

The reference in clause 3 above to the employment of the general manager or another senior staff member, as defined by section 332 of the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW), is a reference to: 

a. the appointment of, or failure to appoint, a person to the vacant position of general manager or to another vacant senior staff position, or

b. the removal, retirement, termination of employment or other cessation of office of the general manager or another senior staff member, or

A party to this Referral Agreement may notify the Commission of a dispute about an industrial matter in accordance with any procedures established by the Commission, for the referral of disputes under a Referral Agreement made pursuant to the provisions of section 146A of the Act.

6.

Prior to the notification of an industrial dispute pursuant to clause 5 above, the parties to this Referral Agreement agree to:

a. notify in writing either, the Council and the LGSA, or, the relevant union parties, of a potential dispute; and

b. where practicable meet with either, the Council and the LGSA, or, the relevant union parties, to discuss and review settlement options.

7.

For the purpose of resolving an industrial dispute, the Commission may convene compulsory conferences and require the attendance of any person whose presence, the Commission considers would help in the resolution of the dispute.

A compulsory conference is to be presided over by a member of the Commission.

8.

The Commission may confer with any person on any matter that may affect the resolution of an industrial dispute, without requiring the person to attend a compulsory conference.

9.

The Commission must first attempt to resolve an industrial dispute by conciliation.

10.

When attempting the conciliation of the industrial dispute, the Commission is to do everything that seems to be proper to assist the parties agree on terms for the resolution of the dispute.

11.

During conciliation proceedings, the Commission may make a recommendation or give a direction to the parties to the industrial dispute.

Failure to comply with any such recommendation or direction may not be penalised but may be taken into account by the Commission in exercising its functions under this Referral Agreement.

12.

The actions that may be taken by the Commission to assist the parties pursuant to clause 10 above includes making arrangements or giving directions for the convening and conduct of conferences of the parties or their representatives (whether or not compulsory conferences and whether or not presided over by a member of the Commission).

13.

The Commission, when dealing with an industrial dispute under this Referral Agreement, must consider whether the parties have bargained in good faith and, in particular, whether the parties have:

a. attended meetings they have agreed to attend, and
b. complied with agreed or reasonable negotiating procedures, and
c. disclosed relevant information for the purposes of negotiation.

The Commission may make recommendations or give directions to the parties to bargain in good faith.

14.

Upon conclusion of the conciliation functions of the Commission outlined above in clauses 7 to 13, the parties to this Referral Agreement may utilise and exercise the same right as is contained in section 173 of the Act.

15.

In the event that a dispute is not resolved through conciliation, then the parties to this Referral Agreement agree to refer a dispute for arbitration by the Commission.

16.

17.

18.

The Commission's power to make an award in accordance with clause 17 shall be limited to the making of an award about a specific issue or issues that are the subject of a dispute notified under this Referral Agreement.

19.

The power conferred upon the Commission in clause 17 is not intended to provide the Commission with the power to make or vary a general award that has industry application.

20.

In giving effect to the powers, orders and functions referred to the Commission in clause 16 above, the parties agree that the provisions, conditions, exclusions, powers and forms contained in the Industrial Relations (General) Regulation 2001 and the Industrial Relations Commission Rules 1996 also operate.

21.

Subject to the operation of clause 22 below, an order, determination or other decision made by the Commission by operation of this Referral Agreement is binding upon the parties to a dispute notified under this Referral Agreement, and is to be implemented forthwith.

22.

A party to this Referral Agreement may appeal any binding order, determination or decision of the Commission arising from the operation of this Referral Agreement.

NOTE: Where required above, this Statement must be accompanied by the relevant Certificate of Currency to comply with section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987.

Version 2
          
Notes
1.

This form is prepared for the purpose of section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, Schedule 2 Part 5 Payroll Tax Act 2007 and section 127 of the Industrial Relation Act 1996.

If this form is completed in accordance with these provisions, a principal contractor is relieved of liability for workers compensation premiums, payroll tax and remuneration payable by the subcontractor.

A principal contractor can be generally defined to include any person who has entered into a contract for the carrying out of work by another person (or other legal entity called the subcontractor) and where employees of the subcontractor are engaged in carrying out the work which is in connection with the principal contractor's business.

2.

For the purpose of this Subcontractor's Statement, a principal contractor is a person (or other legal entity), who has entered into a contract with another person (or other legal entity) referred to as the subcontractor, and employees/workers of that subcontractor will perform the work under contract.

The work must be connected to the business undertaking of the principal contractor.

3.

Provide the unique contract number, title, or other information that identifies the contract.

4.

In order to meet the requirements of s127 Industrial Relations Act 1996, a statement in relation to remuneration must state the period to which the statement relates.

For sequential Statements ensure that the dates provide continuous coverage.

Section 127(11) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 states 'to avoid doubt, this section extends to a principal contractor who is the owner or occupier of a building for the carrying out of work in connection with the building so long as the building is owned or occupied by the principal contractor in connection with a business undertaking of the principal contractor.'

5.

Provide the date of the most recent payment claim.

6.

For Workers Compensation purposes an exempt employer is an employer who pays less than $7500 annually, who does not employ an apprentice or trainee and is not a member of a group.

7.

8.

In completing the Subcontractor's Statement, a subcontractor declares that all remuneration payable to relevant employees for work under the contract has been paid.

9.

In completing the Subcontractor's Statement, a subcontractor declares that all payroll tax payable relating to the work undertaken has been paid.

10.

It is important to note that a business could be both a subcontractor and a principal contractor, if a business 'in turn' engages subcontractors to carry out the work.

If your business engages a subcontractor you are to also obtain Subcontractor's Statements from your subcontractors.

Statement Retention
The principal contractor receiving a Subcontractor's Statement must keep a copy of the Statement for the periods stated in the respective legislation.

This is currently up to seven years.

In terms of s175B of the Workers Compensation Act and clause 18 of Schedule 2 of the Payroll Tax Act 2007 a person who gives the principal contractor a written statement knowing it to be false is guilty of an offence.

Criminal History Information is compiled from the records of Police Services.

These records are drawn from various sources including historical information held by the Police Services, and are held by Police Services for use as an investigative tool.

It was not necessarily intended that these records be used for the purposes of providing Criminal History Information outside the relevant Police Services.

In addition, Criminal History Information was not necessarily intended to be used in the identification of persons for reasons other than ongoing police investigations.

In that context, Criminal History Information is inherently limited and the Accredited Agency should recognise this limitation.

Consequently, in receiving Criminal History Information the Accredited Agency recognises that while a Police Service providing Criminal History Information through CrimTrac will make every practicable endeavour to ensure that the information relates to the Applicant in question and is correct in its detail, neither the Police Service nor CrimTrac accepts any responsibility or liability for any error or omission whatsoever in the information.

C.1.2.

Information provided in relation to a NCHRC under this Contract may not, for one reason or another, relate to the Applicant and further validation may be required.

C.1.3.

The Accredited Agency will bring to the Applicant's notice any matters relating to Criminal History Information obtained from a NCHRC that could cause an adverse decision in respect to their assessment.

C.1.4.

Where the Applicant disputes the accuracy of the information provided from police records, either in part or in full, the Accredited Agency shall take all steps necessary to provide the Applicant with information about the steps the Applicant must take to establish a comparison fingerprint check, and the Accredited Agency will then liaise with CrimTrac in the first instance to determine whether the Criminal History Information released relates to that Applicant.

C.2.

Assessment of the Applicant
C.2.1.

Subject to any relevant legislation, the Accredited Agency may use the Criminal History Information provided about an Applicant in decision processes related to the assessment of suitability for a profession, an undertaking, appointment, or employment.

However, CrimTrac recommends that consideration of the Criminal History Information form only one part of the assessment processes for an Applicant's suitability.

C.2.2.

In forming assessments, the Accredited Agency should consider the relevance of the Criminal History Information to the specific nature of the decision.

Where Criminal History Information is provided, the Accredited Agency will take into account:
a. the scope of the Applicant's criminal history;
b. the nature of the offence and the relationship of the offence to the particular position/profession or other decision under consideration;
c. the period of time that has elapsed since the offence took place;
d. whether the offence was committed as an adult or a juvenile;
e. the type of penalty imposed by the court such as whether the court elects not to record a conviction where the person enters into and successfully completes a conditional order such as bond or probation, and whether the Applicant has successfully completed the order;
f. the severity of any penalty imposed; and
g. whether the offence has been decriminalised or removed from the statutes.

C.2.3.

The Accredited Agency acknowledges that the initial check of the Name provided by the Accredited Agency against the central index of names of persons of interest to Police Services may indicate that further investigation may be required with one or more Police Services.

Subsequent enquiries may show that no Criminal History Information is available for release regarding the Applicant.

In these instances the Accredited Agency will not take the fact that an Applicant is not immediately cleared into account in its assessment.

C.3.

Exemptions from spent convictions legislation
C.3.1.

The Accredited Agency acknowledges that where the Commonwealth or States/Territories have spent convictions/non-disclosure legislation or information release policies, it will not receive details of spent convictions unless there is an applicable exemption or exclusion from such legislation or policies.

D. Protection of Criminal History Information
D.1.

The Accredited Agency will ensure that only the Authorised Officer and Agency Personnel manage Criminal History Information and will restrict access to Criminal History Information and Data on a strict 'need-to-know' basis.

D.2.

The Accredited Agency will keep the Criminal History Information secure and protected by implementing safeguards to prevent loss, unauthorised access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse, including unauthorised reproduction by any means within their respective agencies.

Safeguards are to include:
a.    information to be filed in such a manner as to be accessible only to the Authorised Officer and Agency Personnel;
b. files to be marked 'Personnel-In-Confidence'; and
c. the use of lockable filing systems.

D.3.

CrimTrac will transfer Criminal History Information obtained from Police Services to the Accredited Agency by: 
a. facsimile sent to a dedicated (and, where physically possible, isolated) facsimile number designated by the Accredited Agency; or
b. secure electronic means including but not restricted to encrypted email; or
c. direct access to an appropriate CrimTrac system.

D.4.

The Accredited Agency will transfer Criminal History Information obtained from CrimTrac by: 
a. facsimile sent to a dedicated (and, where physically possible, isolated) facsimile number; or
b. secure electronic means including but not restricted to encrypted email; or
c. direct access to an appropriate CrimTrac system.

D.5.

The Accredited Agency, in consultation with CrimTrac, will implement a system of tracking the despatch, receipt, handling, storage and disposal of the Criminal History Information provided by the Police Services.

E. Retention and Recording of Information by the Accredited Agency
E.1.

The Accredited Agency shall retain as permanent records documents, including but not limited to, original completed Informed Consent forms, confirmation that a NCHRC has been conducted and how the Criminal History Information affected any associated decision making processes within the Accredited Agency.

E.2.

The Accredited Agency will not make Criminal History Information or Copies a permanent part of its records and will retain such Criminal History Information or Copies for a period not exceeding three months of receipt from CrimTrac unless approval to retain the Criminal History Information or Copies for a longer period has been given by CrimTrac in writing.

E.3.

The Accredited Agency is aware that if Criminal History Information is retained for an indefinite time, there is the likelihood that some convictions could become spent and therefore non-disclosable under Commonwealth and some State spent convictions legislation.

Once a conviction becomes spent and thus non-disclosable, the Accredited Agency and its staff risk being in breach of spent convictions legislation, should details of a spent conviction be inadvertently disclosed.

E.4.

Criminal History Information will be destroyed by the Authorised Officer or Agency Personnel authorised to have access to the information by any method that will prevent the identity of the Applicant being deduced from reconstitution of the residue.

16.

CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE

At any time the Superintendent may undertake an evaluation of the Contractor's performance using the Contract Performance Evaluation Procedure.

A copy of the procedure will be made available to the Contractor if requested.

The evaluation, which will include reasons for any below acceptable scores, will be forwarded to the Contractor when completed.

If the Contractor disagrees with the evaluation, they may forward a request to the Superintendent for a review, along with reasons why it should be reviewed.

Following reasonable consideration of the request, the Superintendent's decision will be final.

The evaluation may be taken into account in the assessment of future tenders.

17.

NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT

This Agreement is entered into this _____ day of _______________, 200__, between Traders International, Ltd. ("Company") and ________________________ ("Student").

WHEREAS, Company offers a training course and support services designed to educate students regarding the trading techniques to be utilized in trading in certain futures contracts;

WHEREAS, Student desires to enroll in Company's training course; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, Company and Student agree as follows:

I.

Training Course
A.

Upon the Company's acceptance of this Agreement, the Company agrees to provide to the Student with instruction in trading via an online eCourse or in a manner selected by the Company.

The Company shall provide the Student with materials as the Company deems necessary to instruct and inform the Student.

B.

Upon completion of the eCourse set forth in paragraph I.A., above, the Company shall provide the Student with materials to allow the Student to participate in trading simulations.

The Company will provide the Student with access to the 24/5 Live Trading Room for a period of five weeks (the "training period"), from the date the student activates his/her access.

At the commencement of the 3rd week, student also receives access to the PRO Trading Room (the advanced training room) for three weeks.

It is understood that the instructors will not provide advice or counsel in the form of trading recommendations.

II.

Payment
In consideration for receiving the materials and services set forth in paragraph I., Student agrees to pay the sum of $7,750.00 AUD to the Company.

No refund will be given for any reason after the student receives the course materials.

III.

Non-Disclosure of Proprietary Information
Student acknowledges and understands that Company has devoted a substantial amount of time and effort, and has incurred substantial costs, in 
developing the course materials, the support services, and all information developed in connection with the training ("Proprietary Information").

Company's Proprietary Information includes, without limitation, training course, all written training course materials, marketing and advertising materials and methods, trading methods developed by Company, methods of operations, publications, and business practices.

Company derives economic value, both actual and potential, from not having its Proprietary Information generally known or ascertainable by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.

Additionally, Company has made substantial efforts to ensure that its Proprietary Information remains secret.

Student understands that during the training course he/she will gain access to Company's Proprietary Information.

While Student is certainly entitled, and in fact encouraged, to utilize all of the information obtained through the training course in pursuing his/her goal of learning successfully to trade futures contracts, Student covenants that he/she will not use said Proprietary Information for any purpose inconsistent with the terms and spirit of this Agreement.

Specifically, Student agrees that he/she shall not for any reason, at any time, without the written consent of Company, disclose to any person or entity any of Company's Proprietary Information.

IV.

Covenant Not to Utilize Proprietary Information to Compete with Company
	Student covenants that he/she is enrolling in the training course for the 
sole purpose of becoming educated with the personal goal of learning to trade futures contracts.

Student covenants that he/she is not enrolling in the training course for reasons associated with competing with Company's business enterprise or otherwise obtaining Company's Proprietary Information for any use inconsistent with the teachings of this training course.

Student acknowledges and agrees that Company has a valid and protectable interest in preserving its business enterprise of offering training courses that teach trading methodologies.

V. Reasonableness and Enforceability
The parties hereto have attempted to limit the restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement to the extent necessary reasonably to protect Company's   legitimate business interests.

Student acknowledges that the scope of paragraph III, restricting the disclosure of Company's Proprietary Information, is reasonable.

Student also acknowledges that the scope of paragraph IV, restricting the use of Company's Proprietary Information to compete against the Company, is also reasonable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties recognize that reasonable people may differ in making such a determination.

Consequently, the parties hereby agree that if the scope or enforceability of the covenants set forth in this Agreement is in any way disputed at any time, a court or other trier-of-fact may modify and enforce the covenants to the extent that it believes the covenants to be reasonable under the circumstances existing at that time.

VI.

Representation
By executing this Agreement, Student represents that:

A.

No one affiliated with the Company has guaranteed that utilizing the Company's trading course will result in profits, or avoid losses;

B.

Student is aware that futures trading involves substantial risk of loss;

C. If  Student decides to open a trading account, Student will fund such an account exclusively with risk capital;

D. Student is aware that the Company is not registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is not a member of the National Futures Association, and thus Student will not be afforded certain additional regulatory protections;

E. Any reliance on information provided by the Company is at the sole risk of the Student, and if Student participates in transactions based on such information, Student does so at his or her own risk, and that the Company is in no way responsible for any losses incurred by virtue of Student's participation in such transactions; and

F. Student understands that the Company is not in any way affiliated with or the agent of any futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, and/or commodity pool operator, and thus Student agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless for the acts of such entities or individuals.

G. Student understands that if he / she opens a trading account, the Company is not responsible for losses incurred by Student as the result of adverse market conditions, poor order execution, data feed problems, technical difficulties, market disruptions or suspensions, or any other circumstances which may occur which may have the effect of hindering Student's trading.

H. Student understands that if he / she opens a trading account, Student will be charged brokerage commissions per each contract which will limit the student's ability to profit.

I.

Student understands that if he / she opens a trading account, market conditions may make it difficult or impossible for Student to affect trades at desired prices which will limit Student's ability to profit.

J.

Student understands that the Company only provides the chart based on eSignal or FutureSource, Incorporated.

If Student prefers to use any other vendor for real time charting data, it will be the student's responsibility to set up the charts and indicators.

K. Student has read and understood all of risk disclosures set forth in the Company's website, www.TradersInternational.com with regard to futures trading.

L. Student understands that Student's representations set forth in this paragraph and in this Agreement are conditions precedent without which the Company will not enter into this Agreement.

VII.

Dispute Resolution
A.

General.

Any controversy which touches or concerns this Agreement or Student's enrollment in Company's training course to any degree, however slight, whether it be between Student and Company or any of its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, or affiliates, shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its rules for commercial disputes.

Any arbitration shall take place in Houston, Texas, or as otherwise agreed by the parties.

B.

Relief.

In any such controversy, the arbitrator may grant any relief, legal or equitable, interim or final, which could be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Moreover, this clause shall not preclude either party from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from any state or federal court in Harris County, Texas, the parties consenting to the jurisdiction of such court.

C. Authority.

This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the United States of America and to the laws of the State of Texas.

Additionally, this arbitration provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

VIII.

Term
The term of the Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above and continue in full force and effect consistent with the terms and the scope of the restrictive covenants set forth in Sections IV and V, above.

IX.

Waiver
The failure of either party to exercise any right or remedy available to it under this Agreement or at law shall not constitute a waiver of the later exercise thereof.

X. Severability
Any invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall not affect any other provision hereunder and the remainder of the Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be over broad, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, Company and Student agree that the court may modify or amend such provision to allow for enforcement to the maximum extent permitted under the law.

XI.

Entire Agreement
This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties and may only be modified by a written instrument signed by both parties.

Further, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their heirs, successors, and assigns.

XII.

Counterparts
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, any one of which shall be deemed the original without reference to the others.

The Northern TerritoryRecitals  A On 7 November 1997, the Parties signed the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement with the objective of establishing a uniform national framework for third party access to natural gas pipelines.

B Under the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement, the Parties agreed upon a uniform "Gas Pipelines Access Law", which included a "National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems".

C In accordance with the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement, the State of South Australia passed the Gas Pipelines Access (South Australia) Act 1997, which applied the Gas Pipelines Access Law (comprising Schedule 1 (Third Party Access to Natural Gas Pipelines) and Schedule 2 (National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems (the Code)) as a law of South Australia.

D In accordance with the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement, each other Party (except the State of Western Australia) has passed application legislation applying the Gas Pipelines Access Law as set out in Schedules 1 and 2 to the Gas Pipelines Access (South Australia) Act 1997, as laws of that Party.

The State of Western Australia has enacted the Gas Pipelines Access (Western Australia) Act 1998, which has essentially identical effect to the Gas Pipelines Access (South Australia) Act 1997 and applies the Gas Pipelines Access Law as set out in Schedules to the Western Australian Act as law of the State of Western Australia.

E Section 6 of Schedule 1 of the Gas Pipelines Access Law and section 9 of the Code establish a procedure whereby the Code may be amended.

The Company may refuse at its sole and absolute discretion to accept any Goods for carriage without assigning any reason.

Standing or general instructions, or instructions given late, even if received by the Company without comment, shall not be binding upon the Company.

If the Company adopts standing or general instructions, or instructions given late, for one of more transaction for the Customer or any other party, that does not in any way affect the validity of those instructions in relation to any future transaction.

No attempt by the Company to adopt late instructions will constitute an acceptance by the Company or affect the validity of those instructions.

That discretion will be varied only by instructions delivered by the Customer to the Company in writing and acknowledged by the Company in writing in sufficient time before the performance of any service to reasonably allow the Company to adopt the manner of performing the service required by the special instructions.

THE COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE A CHANGE IN THE RATES OF DUTY, WHARFAGE, FREIGHT, RAILAGE OR CARTAGE, OR ANY OTHER TARIFF BEFORE OR AFTER THE PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANY ACT INVOLVING A LESS FAVOURABLE RATE OR TARIFF, OR BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT A SAVING MAY HAVE BEEN EFFECTED IN SOME OTHER WAY HAD ANY ACT BEEN PERFORMED AT A DIFFERENT TIME AND WHETHER ITS PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF THE ACTS AFORESAID IS DELAYED OR PRECIPITATED THROUGH THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SERVANTS OR AGENTS OR HOWEVER CAUSED.

Any such contract may be made upon the terms of contract used by the Sub-contractor with whom the Company may contract for the Services and may be made upon the terms and subject to the conditions of any special contract which the Sub-contractor may in any particular case require, including in every case any term that the Sub-contractor may employ any person, firm or company for performance of the Services so contracted for.

The indemnity shall continue in force and effect whether or not the Goods have been pillaged, stolen, lost, damaged or destroyed and shall not be affected in any way if such pillaging, stealing, loss, damage or destruction has occurred or been brought about wholly or in part by the negligence or the alleged negligence or any default, omission, neglect or default or any breach of duty of obligation of the Company, its servants or agents.

Insurance 
(19) The Company shall not effect insurance on the Goods except upon receipt of express instructions given in writing by the Customer and the Customer's written declaration as to the value of the Goods.

All such insurances effected by the Company are subject to the usual exceptions and conditions of the policies of the insurer or underwriter taking the risk.

At the discretion of the Company such insurance may name the Customer or owner as insured.

In the event of any dispute in regard to liability under any such insurance policy for any reason whatsoever the Customer or other insured shall have recourse against the insurer or underwriter only and the Company shall have no liability or responsibility in relation to any such insurance policy.

Storage and Transport 
(20) Subject to express instructions in writing given by the Customer and accepted by the Company in writing (and without limiting the generality of clauses 7 and 8), the Company reserves to itself complete freedom to decide upon the means, route and procedure to be followed in the handling, storage and transportation of the Goods and is entitled and authorised to engage Sub-contractors to perform all or any of the functions required of the Company upon such terms and conditions as the Company in its absolute discretion may deem appropriate.

Pillaged Goods 
(25) If the Goods are landed from any vessel in a damaged or pillaged condition and an examination might be held or other action taken by the Company in respect of thereof no responsibility attaches to the Company for any failure to hold such examination or take such other action unless the Company has been given sufficient notice to enable it to arrange for such examination or for the taking of such other action as the case may be.

The Customer will indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless against any claims for loss or damage to their Goods incurred whilst they were in the possession of the airline carrier.

(32) The Company and Customer acknowledge that Goods moving by seafreight are subject to the applicable international treaties including the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to Bill of Lading signed at Brussels on August 25, 1924 (the Hague Rules), or those rules as amended by the Protocol signed at Brussels on February 23, 1968 (the Hague Visby Rules) and the SDR Protocol (1979).

We will carry out the inspection and report ordered by You in accordance with this agreement and You agree to pay for the inspection and the report on delivery of the report.

In ordering the inspection, You agree that the inspection will be carried out in accordance with the following clauses, which define the scope and limitations of the inspection and the report.

SCOPE OF THE INSPECTION & THE REPORT:  
1.

Standards Australia has only written two of five Inspection of building Standards.

Therefore, as a result, all the inspections will be carried out in accordance with AS 4349.1-1995 with the exception of TABLE 1 REASONABLE ACCESS.

The Access Table to be used will be that shown in Clause 20 Definitions on page 3.

2.

A copy of these two Standards may be obtained from RAPID Solutions at Your cost by phoning (02) 4954 3655 or from Standards Australia.

3.

All inspections will be a non-invasive visual inspection and will be limited to those areas and sections of the property to which Reasonable Access (Clause 20 Definitions page 3) is both available and permitted on the date and time of the inspection.

4.

The Inspection WILL NOT involve any invasive inspection including cutting, breaking apart, dismantling, removing or moving objects including, but not limited to, roofing, wall and ceiling sheeting, ducting, foliage, mouldings, debris, roof insulation, sarking, sisalation, floor or wall coverings, sidings, fixtures, floors, pavers, furnishings, appliances or personal possessions.

5.

The inspector CANNOT see or inspect inside walls, between floors, inside skillion roofing, inside the eaves, behind stored goods in cupboards, in other areas that are concealed or obstructed.

Insulation and sisalation in the roof void will conceal timbers and may make inspection of the area unsafe for the inspector.

The inspector WILL NOT dig, gouge, force or perform any other invasive procedures.

An invasive inspection will not be performed unless a separate contract is entered into.

6.

The inspection WILL NOT report on the presence or not of Timber Pest activity.

You should have an inspection carried out in accordance with AS 4349.3-1998 Timber Pest Inspections, by a fully qualified, licensed and insured Timber Pest Inspector.

7.

If Timber Pest damage is found then it will be reported.

The inspector will only then report on the damage which is readily visible.

There may be concealed damage in walls etc and We strongly recommend You arrange for Us to carry out an invasive inspection to discover the full extent of the damage.

If any evidence of Timber Pest damage is reported then Timber Pest activity may also be present.

It is very important that You have an AS 4349.3-1998 Timber Pest Inspection carried out by a fully qualified, licensed and insured Timber Pest Inspector.

8.

ASBESTOS: "No inspection for asbestos will be carried out at the property and no report on the presence or absence of asbestos will be provided.

If during the course of the Inspection asbestos or materials containing asbestos happened to be noticed then this may be noted in the general remarks section of the report.

Buildings built prior to 1982 may have wall and/or ceiling sheeting and other products including roof sheeting that contains Asbestos.

Even building built after this date up until the early 90s may contain some Asbestos.

Sheeting should be fully sealed.

If concerned or if the building was built prior to 1990 you should seek advice from a qualified asbestos removal expert as to the amount and importance of the asbestos present and the cost of sealing or removal.

If asbestos is noted as present within the property then you should seek advice from a qualified asbestos removal expert as to the amount and importance of the asbestos present and the cost sealing or of removal.

Drilling, cutting or removing sheeting or products containing Asbestos is a high risk to peoples' health.

You should seek advice from a qualified asbestos removal expert."

9.

MOULD (MILDEW AND NON-WOOD DECAY FUNGI) DISCLAIMER: Mildew and non wood decay fungi is commonly known as Mould.

However, Mould and their spores may cause health problems or allergic reactions such as asthma and dermatitis in some people.

No inspection for Mould will be carried out at the property and no report on the presence or absence of Mould will be provided.

If in the course of the Inspection, Mould happened to be noticed it may be noted in the general remarks section of the report.

If Mould is noted as present within the property or if you notice Mould and you are concerned as to the possible health risk resulting from its presence then you should seek advice from your local Council, State or Commonwealth Government Health Department or a qualified expert such as an Industry Hygienist
10.

ESTIMATING DISCLAIMER: Any estimates provided in the report are merely opinions of possible costs that could be encountered, based on the knowledge and experience of the inspector, and are not estimates in the sense of being a calculation of the likely costs to be incurred.

The estimates are NOT a guarantee or quotation for work to be carried out.

The actual cost is ultimately dependent upon the materials used, standard of work carried out, and what a contractor is prepared to do the work for.

It is recommended in ALL instances that multiple independent quotes are sourced prior to any work being carried out.

The inspector accepts no liability for any estimates provided throughout this report.

11.

If the property to be inspected is occupied then You must be aware that furnishings or household items may be concealing evidence of problems, which may only be revealed when the items are moved or removed.

In some cases the concealment may be deliberate.

If You are the purchaser and not the owner of the property to be inspected then You should obtain a statement from the owner as to any Timber Pest activity or damage, timber repairs or other repairs, alterations or other problems to the property known to them and what, if any, other work has been carried out to the property including Timber Pest treatments.

It is important to obtain copies of any paperwork issued and the details of all work carried out.

Ideally the information obtained should be given to the inspector prior to the inspection being carried out.

12.

Subject to reasonable access (Clause 20 Definitions page 3) the Inspection will normally report on the conditions of each of the following areas: -
* The interior
* The roof void
* The exterior
* The subfloor
* The roof exterior
* The property within the boundaries up to 50 metres including fences, but will not report on pools, spas or ponds etc.

You should obtain the services of a pool specialist to carry out an inspection and report.

13.

The inspections Will not cover or report on the following conditions (see AS 4349.1-1995 for full details): -
* Environmental matters such as aspect, sunlight, privacy, streetscape, views etc.

14.

A full list and details of the areas and item to be inspected are contained on Pages 7 through to 12 (inclusive) of the Australian Standard AS 4349.1-1995.

15.

Where the property is a strata or similar title, the inspector will only inspect the interior and immediate exterior of the particular unit requested to be inspected.

16.

The inspector will report the conditions that on the day and at the time of the inspection were evident and visible.

The Australian Standard AS 4349.1-1995 warns that the report must not be seen as an all-encompassing report but rather as a "reasonable attempt to identify significant defects".

Minor defects and imperfections will not be reported.

Such defects and imperfections would in most cases be readily viewable by You.

17.

The inspection and report CANNOT report on any defects which may not be apparent due to prevailing weather conditions at the time of the inspection.

Such defects may only become apparent in differing weather conditions.

18.

AGREEMENT FOR ENGAGEMENT OF CONSULTANT - REAL ESTATE


THE CONSULTANT AGREES AS FOLLOWS:

1.

The Client engages the Consultant to provide Services for the Project named in the accompanying letter ("the letter").

2.

The Consultant shall perform the Services described in the letter and comply with all instructions given by the Client in respect of this Agreement, and the Client is not responsible for any costs resulting from any unauthorised act of the Consultant.

3.

The Consultant shall exercise a professional standard of skill, care and diligence in the performance of all services and other obligations under this Agreement.

The Consultant must at all times be and remain licensed under the Real Estate and Business Agents Act 1978 and comply with the provisions of that Act.

4.

The Consultant shall promptly notify the Client of any matter which will or is likely to change, or has changed the scope or timing of the Services.

5.

(a)	The Client shall make available to the Consultant all information reasonably necessary (the "Information") to fulfil the Client's requirements for the Services.

However, the Consultant acknowledges the Information, and other information relevant to any of the Client's activities that the Consultant becomes aware of by virtue of its engagement by the Client, is confidential (the "Confidential Information") and must remain confidential, regardless of whether the Confidential Information has been or will be released into the public domain.

The Consultant may only use the Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement and may not disclose it to any person, other than the Consultant's officers and employees without the Client's prior written consent to each disclosure.

The Consultant shall not, subject to 12 below make use of any Confidential Information to gain an advantage for himself or herself or someone else or to cause detriment to the Client.

The Consultant acknowledges that the duty to maintain the Confidential Information in confidence shall continue after the services have been provided or the Agreement is terminated.

(b)	Subject to clause 5(c), in the event that the Confidential Information will or has been released into the public domain, the Consultant will, at the Client's expense, assist the Client in any action or conduct necessary to prevent dissemination or further dissemination of the Confidential Information.

If the release or pending release of the Confidential Information into the public domain is a consequence of the Consultant's act or omission or that of each or any of its employees, agents, or subcontractors, then the Consultant shall do all things considered by the Client to be necessary, at the Consultant's expense, to prevent dissemination or further dissemination of the Confidential Information.

(c)	The Consultant may disclose Confidential Information to persons who have a need to know for the purposes of this Agreement (and only to the extent that each has a need to know) and have agreed in writing with the Consultant to comply with substantially the same obligations in respect of Confidential Information as those imposed on the Consultant under this Agreement (a "Direction").

The Consultant must ensure that each person to whom it discloses Confidential Information under this clause complies with its Direction and notify the Client of, and take all steps to prevent or stop, any suspected or actual breach of a Direction.

If the Consultant is required by law to disclose any Confidential Information to a third person (including, but not limited to, government) the Consultant must, before doing so, notify the Client and give the Client a reasonable opportunity to take any steps that the Client considers necessary to protect the confidentiality of that Information and notify the third person that the Confidential Information is confidential information of the Client.

6.

(a)		The Client shall pay to the Consultant fees and reimbursable expenses at the times and in the manner set out in the letter.

(b)		The Consultant will give to the Client a tax invoice for the Services performed and for reimbursable expenses actually incurred at the times specified in the letter.

If the parties are unable to reach agreement within 14 days of the Client's notice, the dispute may be determined at the instigation of either party in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement relating to disputes.

7.

Goods and Services Tax
Consideration under this contract includes full provision for liabilities of the supplier incurred as a result of the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST).

8.

The Consultant must at the Consultant's own expense effect and maintain throughout the term of this Agreement adequate public liability insurance for an amount of not less than $20,000,000, workers compensation insurance in compliance with all applicable legislation and professional indemnity insurance with minimum cover of at least $5,000,000 with insurers approved by the Client and on terms and conditions approved by the Client.

Prior to signing of the Agreement and at any time thereafter on the request of the Client the Consultant must produce evidence of such insurances.

9.

The Consultant will indemnify and keep indemnified the Client against any loss, liability, cost or expense arising out of their provision of the services.

10.

The Consultant shall have the power to act as the Client's agent in emergency situations where danger to persons or damage to the property or works appears imminent.

11.

(a)	All trade marks, copyrights, patents, photographs, reports, notes, specifications, drawings, designs, statistics, models and other information or data compiled or prepared in connection with this Agreement (the "Intellectual Property") shall be the Client's property.

(b)	For the purposes of section 35 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), the parties agree that any copyright created by the Consultant, its officers or employees under this Agreement will be the Client's property.

Furthermore in regard to photographs, the Client's copyright in a photograph continues to subsist until the expiration of 50 years after the expiration of the calendar year in which it was taken.

(c)	Upon the Client's request, the Consultant agrees to immediately execute, or take all necessary steps to ensure execution by any third party to this Agreement, any document necessary to assign the Intellectual Property to the Client, whether created or prepared by the Consultant or any third party to this Agreement.

In the event that ownership of any Intellectual Property is deemed not to have passed until the execution of any necessary documents, the Consultant hereby grants an irrevocable, royalty free licence to the Client to use the Intellectual Property for any purpose.

(d)	This clause does not affect the intellectual property rights the Consultant had in existence prior to the date of engagement of the Consultant, as set out in Schedule 1.

12.

The Consultant will not and shall ensure that its employees do not disclose or make public any information concerning the operations or activities of the Client acquired or obtained in the course of the performance of the Services.

13.

If the Client and the Consultant are in dispute regarding any matter arising out of this Agreement, then either party may, by notice in writing served on the other, request that such dispute be resolved by expert determination of an independent third party acceptable to both parties.

If the parties do not agree to such determination within 7 days from the date of service of the notice then the dispute shall be determined by arbitration, as provided by clause 15.

If the parties do agree to a determination the independent third party shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator, and his decision shall be final and binding upon the parties.

14.

Disputes under or arising out of this Agreement may be referred by either party to arbitration.

The arbitrator shall be a person appointed by the President, for the time being of the Institute of Arbitrators Australia.

The provisions of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1985 shall apply to such arbitration.

15.

The costs of any expert determination or arbitration proceedings pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne by the parties as the expert or arbitrator may direct.

16.

Irrespective of any other provision in this Agreement, the Client may terminate this Agreement by notice to the Consultant if:

	(a)	The Consultant shall have failed to remedy a breach of this Agreement within 7 days from the receipt of a written notice from the Client specifying the breach and requiring that the same be remedied.

(b)	Any event or circumstances shall have occurred which, in the reasonable opinion of the Client, make it unlikely that the Services will be completed by the Consultant in accordance with this Agreement.

(c)	The Client serves a notice on the Consultant requiring that the Agreement be terminated on a date specified in the notice being not less than 30 days from the date of the notice.

(d)	The Consultant fails, refuses or neglects to comply with any instruction or direction given to it by the Client pursuant to this Agreement.

17.

Nothing in clause 17 shall be taken as in any way restricting any right of the Client to claim and institute proceedings for damages arising out of any breach of this Agreement by the Consultant.

18.

The Client may at any time, by notice in writing to the Consultant, reduce, curtail or discontinue any or all Services described in the letter.

Upon such notice being given, the Consultant shall cease or reduce work according to the tenor of the notice and shall immediately do everything possible to mitigate losses as a result of such reduction, curtailment or discontinuance.

19.

The Consultant may, by notice in writing served on the Client, terminate the consultant's obligations under this Agreement if the client is in breach of the provisions of clause 6 and the breach has not been remedied within 28 days of the service by the Consultant on the Client of a notice requiring the breach to be remedied.

20.

The Consultant shall not assign, sublet or transfer any right or obligation under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Client.

21.

If circumstances arise which require expertise outside the field of practice of the Consultant, the Consultant may, with the prior written approval of the Client, engage an appropriate Sub-Consultant to perform relevant Services under this Agreement.

The Consultant shall be responsible for the engagement of and payment for any Services provided by Sub-Consultants, and shall accept responsibility for those Services.

22.

If the Consultant shall for any reason fail to perform any obligations under this Agreement, the Client may (without prejudice to any right of action or any other rights that the Client may have in respect of such failure) be entitled to have such unperformed works carried out at the expense of the Consultant by any other person.

23.

During the term of this Agreement, the Consultant will not provide services to any party (other than the Client) which, in the Client's opinion, presents a conflict of interest, without the prior written consent of the Client.

BY SIGNING THE LETTER OF ENGAGEMENT, THE CONSULTANT AGREES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CITED ABOVE.

	(a)	identification of the sender (authenticated as provided for in clause 4);
	(b)	the identification of the addressee;

5.

Receipt of Transmission
5.1	A party must send an Acknowledgement of each Message before acting on it.

Evidence and Contractual Effect
9.1	The parties shall not dispute that a Message passing between them is "in writing" or a "document" merely on the grounds that the Message was transmitted electronically.

Procedural Guide

1.

Testing, 'Going Live'

	Once each party has installed the necessary eCommerce software they will exchange relevant details to enable an electronic interchange to take place.

Test documents are to be produced and sent to the parties, indicating that the document is a test document only.

Both parties are to ensure that the data is being translated, interchanged and re-translated correctly in the agreed format before completing testing.

Once the parties agree that the electronic system has been successfully tested then the system shall be deemed as a production or "live" system.

Until then Messages will be of no legal effect.

Paper copies or other agreed medium, where they exist, will continue to be sent until their deletion is agreed by both parties.

2.

Problem Resolution

	If a party encounters any problem that could affect the other party or result in failure of a Message to be transmitted, and is un-recoverable, then the party with the problem will notify the other party within 24 hours.

	received.

Contingency

	If the electronic system is unavailable to any party then that party must notify the other with consideration to various options such as: revert to the previous paper-based system, suspend trading temporarily or use an alternative network.

4.

Acknowledgements
Each party receiving a Message must provide an Acknowledgment to the sender.

An Acknowledgement must be in the format agreed and tested under Clause 1 above.

An Acknowledgement does not imply acceptance of the value of the data in the Message.

5.

Lost Message Retrieval

	If a Message is 'lost' after being received, the recipient will ask its eCommerce provider (if any) to re-send the Message.

Only if this is not possible will they ask the sender to re-send the Message.

6.

	Each party shall develop and use security procedures as a prudent company would develop and use to ensure that all transmissions of Messages, equipment, and the network are secure from access not authorised by each party and to protect the business records and data contained therein from loss, alteration or destruction.

Each party shall, upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorised use of transmission, immediately inform the other party, investigate the breach and report to the other party as to the outcome of the investigation.

The use of eCommerce shall be suspended until security has been re-established to the satisfaction of the parties.

The party responsible for the breach of security shall pay the costs of any legal proceedings against a person who has committed an act of unauthorised disclosure.

7.	eCommerce Provider

	A party may, by notice in writing to the other party, nominate another entity as an eCommerce provider to perform some or all of its obligations under this Agreement.

The party remains responsible for performance of these obligations and for ensuring that the eCommerce Provider complies with applicable provisions of this Agreement.

Each party will bear its own costs of depositing outgoing documents and retrieving incoming documents.

In the event of any dispute which may arise as to whether a Message has been sent or received, it will be the responsibility of the sender to supply details of the transmission date and time that the Message was sent, the envelope and the date the transaction was acknowledged if applicable.

Both parties agree to assist in any joint investigation with their eCommerce provider if required to resolve these disputes.

8.

	Both parties agree to access their production system on each Business Day.

AGREEMENT

 BETWEEN

THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES OF 

THE STATES AND TERRITORIES OF AUSTRALIA

AND 

THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION

AND

THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

AND

THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
for the purposes of this Agreement represented by the

AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS

AND

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND AGEING

AND

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS' AFFAIRS


 (2004 to 2009)

Concerning the establishment of structures and processes through which the Commonwealth, State and Territory health and statistical authorities will develop agreed programs to improve, maintain and share national health information.

1.

PREAMBLE

The planning and provision of health services and health programs are important and complex undertakings in which governments, government instrumentalities, private organisations, health professionals, academics, community groups and individuals have shared responsibilities.

The national health system operates within finite resources that cannot be expected to increase significantly in real terms.

The system is required to meet increasing demands and changing needs and is experiencing major technological advances.

Health and statistical authorities are committed to micro economic and structural reform and to being responsible and accountable for their expenditure and impact.

Information is required about health services and health service consumers; and about environmental and human factors that may affect health.

To ensure that essential, accurate, reliable and timely information is available nationwide for and about the health system a coordinated approach and agreed rules are needed to facilitate jurisdictional cooperation, efficient and effective utilisation of financial and intellectual resources.

Health service information is generated by health professionals, health administrators and government agencies in the conduct of their normal activities.

Consistent with sound management and commercial practice and protection of individual privacy, the use of this information should be optimised.

Collections should be rationalised to eliminate duplication and minimise the need for special collections.

The framework provided by this Agreement should also assist, where appropriate, consistency between health, community services and housing assistance information.

As governments provide or finance almost 70% of all health services, and largely fund the training of health professionals, they are major producers and users of health information.

Therefore, the Agreement will cover government authorities initially but efforts will be made to involve other sectors in the processes and possibly in the Agreement itself.

This Agreement is to ensure that the collection, compilation and interpretation of national information are appropriate and are carried out efficiently.

This will require agreement on definitions, standards and rules of collection of information and on guidelines for the co-ordination of access, interpretation and publication of national health information.

This Agreement retains the main features and scope of the Agreement developed in 1993 and incorporates amendments to reflect the significant changes to health information governance introduced in 2003 and the increased emphasis on consistency in data standards between health, community services and housing assistance.

It also includes the Commonwealth Department of Veterans' Affairs as a signatory.

The Agreement provides for the addition of schedules to the Agreement to cater for specific requirements, where agreed by relevant parties or to provide more detail on specific matters.

The Australian community will be the beneficiaries of this Agreement as the result of better and more timely information, more appropriate provision of services, improved health outcomes and improved efficiency.

For the purposes of this Agreement, 'health information' is data or derived information, or indices, recorded or published in any medium, including data concerned with:

MEDIATION AGREEMENT
A dispute, briefly described in the schedule, has arisen between the persons there named as the disputants, who have requested Strategic Action Pty Limited ACN 003 566 210 of 2 Crown Street, Woolloomooloo, New South Wales 2011, Australia, carrying on business as STRATEGIC RESOLUTION, to help them resolve it.

The person named in the schedule as the mediator is an employee of Strategic Resolution.

APPOINTMENT OF STRATEGIC RESOLUTION AND ROLE OF MEDIATOR
1.1	The disputants appoint Strategic Resolution to help them resolve the dispute.

Strategic Resolution agrees to make the mediator available to them for that purpose.

Impartially, the mediator will assist the disputants to negotiate their own agreed solution and will not impose decisions on the disputants nor give legal or other advice.

1.2	If the dispute is the subject of pending court proceedings in a jurisdiction in which, without attendance at court, an order may be made by consent that the dispute or any part of it may be referred for mediation, the disputants will obtain, prior to the mediation, an order to the effect: "By consent, these proceedings be referred for mediation by [name of the mediator]" and will serve a copy on the mediator.

1.

THE MEDIATION
2.1	The mediator may communicate by any means with the disputants and may meet with the disputants together or with any disputant alone.

The disputants agree to co-operate with the mediator and each other disputant in the conduct of the mediation and to use their best endeavours to comply with reasonable requests made by the mediator to promote the efficient resolution of the dispute.

If the mediator believes the mediation is no longer productive or that any party is abusing the process or if the mediator learns something in confidence that makes it impossible for the mediator to continue to participate, the mediator may withdraw from the mediation immediately by giving written or oral notice to the disputants, who must then appoint another mediator unless a disputant withdraws.

3.

CONFIDENTIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
3.1	The parties agree that unless compelled by law or otherwise agreed they will preserve total confidentiality in relation to proceedings within the mediation including all exchanges that may come to their knowledge concerning the dispute passing between any of the disputants or between a disputant and the mediator, however communicated.

This obligation does not apply to information that becomes public knowledge otherwise than by reason of a breach of this agreement.

3.2	Within the mediation, information disclosed privately to the mediator shall be treated as confidential and may not be disclosed by the mediator to another person without prior permission.

Non-confidential information provided to the mediator must be given immediately to each other disputant.

3.3	The mediator shall be under no obligation to retain, following the mediation, documents, electronic records or notes made by or provided to the mediator in the course of or for the purposes of the mediation.

4.

EFFECT OF MEDIATION
4.1	The parties are in accord with the public policy of encouraging disputants to settle their differences rather than litigate.

If the mediation resolves the dispute in whole or in part, the disputants must record their points of agreement in writing before concluding the mediation.

If the mediation does not resolve the entire dispute, this agreement and the mediation will not affect the rights of any disputant in relation to issues that remain in dispute.

5.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
5.1	Strategic Resolution or the mediator, as the case may be, will immediately inform the disputants of any circumstance of which they become aware that might reasonably be considered to affect the mediator's capacity to act impartially.

The disputants will then confer and if agreed continue with the mediation before the mediator.

6.

Each disputant may appoint one or more other persons including legally qualified persons to assist and advise the disputant in the mediation as the disputant thinks fit.

7.

SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS
7.1	All parties acknowledge that information, electronic communications and documents brought into existence for and statements made in the mediation are privileged and are inadmissible in proceedings to determine issues in the dispute.

In particular, client legal privilege shall not be waived by the disclosure in the mediation of an electronic communication or document to which that privilege attaches.

Nevertheless, a disputant may prove objective facts by direct evidence in any proceedings, notwithstanding that knowledge of those facts was obtained through a privileged communication.

7.3	Following the mediation, neither Strategic Resolution nor the mediator will accept appointment as an arbitrator in or act as an advocate in any arbitral or judicial proceeding relating to the dispute nor provide advice to a disputant in relation to the dispute.

No disputant will do anything to cause the mediator to breach this clause.

8.

PAYMENT
8.1	The disputants must pay Strategic Resolution's fees for providing the mediator at the rate of AUD 395.00 per hour plus GST plus any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred.

Each disputant must bear equally the fees and expenses.

At the conclusion of the mediation, Strategic Resolution will either invoice the disputants any shortfall or refund to them any excess.

The Recipient indemnifies the University for any liability, loss, costs, damages and expenses (including legal costs and expenses) incurred or suffered by the University from any claim or demand by any other person due to or arising from the use, storage or disposal of the Material or Data by the Recipient, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the University.

The University may only withhold approval to defer termination on reasonable grounds, including imminent health risk, obligations to third parties or IPRs infringement.

A failure or delay in exercise of a right arising from a breach of this agreement does not constitute a waiver of that right.

Each party submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that place.

As these scholarships are provided tax exempt and are not in the nature of a consultancy, reporting too frequently could affect the taxable status of the award.

Sample Agreement for publishers and print disability organisations 
AGREEMENT
Parties
This agreement is between:
_________________________ ["the Publisher"] 
and 
_________________________ ["the Organisation"].

The Publisher agrees to grant the Organisation the Licence set out in Part One of this Agreement.

Where the Publisher agrees to provide digital files of its books to the Organisation, it does so on the terms and conditions set out in Part Two of this Agreement.

Definitions
"Individual Copies" means copies of the Master Copy made by the Organisation for use by individuals with a print disability.

"Interim Copies" means any copies of an Original File that the Organisation makes in the process of creating a Master Copy.

"Master Copy" means a copy of the Original File in one or more of the formats set out in Part 2 (whether or not that copy has been edited, amended or adapted or contains additional material) and held by the Organisation.

"Members" means individuals with a print disability who are members, clients or students of the Organisation.

The "Online Delivery Requirements" are that, whenever the Organisation makes a Master or Individual Copy, or a copy of any of the Publisher's Books made under section 135ZP, available online:
* access to copies of the Publisher's Books online is password-protected;
* access to copies of the Publisher's Books online is available only to Members of the Organisation and to people acting on behalf of the Organisation;
* as a condition for having access to the Publisher's Books online, the Organisation requires its Members to agree not to reveal their password to any other person and not to make copies of the Publisher's Books (or the online material generally) available to any other person; and
* if the Organisation becomes aware that a Member has made copies of any substantial part of these books available to any other person, the Organisation takes action within 14 days to suspend that person's online access to material for at least 30 days; and
* people working for the Organisation are made aware of the need to limit access to the Original File and all reproductions of it.

"Original File" means a digital file of a Book supplied by the Publisher under Part Two of this Agreement.

"the Publisher's Books" means books for which the Publisher controls the rights to copy and communicate within Australia.

Where Accessible Copy is to be made in Braille
If the Organisation wishes to make a copy of one of the Publisher's Books under section 135ZP of the Copyright Act, it is not required to check for commercial availability if the Accessible Copy is to be made in Braille.

b.

Where commercially available formats are not accessible to individuals with a print disability
If any of the Publisher's Books is commercially available in one of the formats set out in section 135ZP of the Copyright Act, but is not accessible to a particular Member (for example because it is available as an e-book in a format that cannot be accessed by the user's adaptive software), the Organisation may make and supply an accessible copy to that Member.

c. Checking for commercial availability where accessible copies are provided online
If the Organisation makes any of the Publisher's Books available online to its Members under section 135ZP of the Copyright Act, it will meet the requirement to check for commercial availability by making the check once every twelve months while the work remains available online, provided it meets the Online Delivery Requirements.

(Strike out whichever is not applicable).

Making copies in accessible formats
When the Publisher supplies an Original File, the Organisation may:
* make Interim Copies and communicate them within the organisation as required for the purposes of making a Master Copy;
* make any alterations, deletions and additions necessary to make a Master Copy of the Original File (except any alterations that would infringe the moral rights of any person); and
* make Individual Copies as needed by its Members.

b.

Supplying Individual copies to individuals with a print disability
The Organisation may lend, communicate or give Individual Copies to its Members, provided that:
* the Organisation requires its Members to agree not to make Individual Copies available to any other person or organisation (including by lending the Individual Copy); and
* to the extent that is practicable, copy-protection measures are used (if required by the Publisher and as agreed between the Publisher and the Organisation).

c. Making Individual Copies available online to Members
The Organisation may make Individual Copies available online to its Members, provided that, in addition to the requirements set out in clause 2.2b, it meets the Online Delivery Requirements.

Scoping Agreement for Victorian Regional Forest Agreements between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Victoria
Preamble 
1.

The purpose of this Scoping Agreement is to confirm the intention of the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments to proceed to the negotiation of Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) for the East Gippsland, Central Highlands, North East, Gippsland and Western regions, and to establish processes and timetables for their completion.

1.1.

The provisions of this Agreement are not intended to give rise to legally enforceable rights or obligations between the Commonwealth and Victoria.

1.2.

1.3.

2.

The Commonwealth and Victoria agree that this Scoping Agreement and each RFA negotiated will be consistent (including with respect to the definition of terms) with the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) and, consistent with clause 1.2, other relevant agreements and policies including the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD) and the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE).

The Commonwealth and Victoria recognise that this Agreement, and each RFA negotiated, cannot impose on a party hereto or any other third party any obligation that is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth or of Victoria where that law is binding upon that party hereto or that third party.

Objectives 
3.

The Commonwealth and Victorian Governments believe that the long-term ecologically sustainable management of forests and the development of competitive and efficient forest industries are compatible objectives and therefore they are committed to providing a basis for these objectives in the regions covered by this Agreement, thereby ensuring the protection of conservation values, the basis for an internationally competitive forest products industry, and the effective use of other economic and social resources of each region.

4.

Regional Forest Agreement 
5.

On the signing of this Scoping Agreement, the Commonwealth Government, undertakes to fulfil its obligations with respect to the processes and milestones as set out in Attachments 1 & 2 for the development of RFAs.

5.1.

On the signing of this Scoping Agreement, the Victorian Government, undertakes to fulfil its obligations with respect to the processes and milestones as set out in Attachments 1 & 2 for the development of RFAs.

5.2.

This Scoping Agreement commits the Governments and relevant agencies to undertake the necessary assessments to meet both Governments' statutory and policy obligations within the timeframe as outlined at Attachment 2.

The Governments and relevant agencies agree that the studies and processes outlined in Attachment 1 will constitute the full assessment of identified values for the purposes of negotiating each RFA.

The Governments further agree to cooperate actively to meet the overall program milestones outlined in Attachment 2 and that the timetable and outcomes in Attachments 1 & 2 may be varied by mutual consent.

6.

7.

Both governments agree that for Victoria to achieve significant progress for the purposes of the Commonwealth's export woodchip policy, it will be necessary for Victoria to comply with this Agreement, in particular to adhere to the milestones in Attachment 2 of this Agreement, and to comply with the terms of the Interim Forest Agreement.

Each Government further undertakes to consider expeditiously any request from the other Government to vary these nominated milestones and, subject to clause 1.2, to not unreasonably withhold its approval of any variations to the milestones or outcomes consistent with the objectives of this Agreement.

Definition of the Region 
8.

This scoping agreement applies to the regions shown on the map at Attachment 3.

In developing the RFA which shall apply to each of these regions, regard will be given to native forest on public land and where necessary and appropriate to native forest on private land.

Both parties further agree to develop an order of priority for assessing those regions.

9.

To capture the full economic and social context for the RFAs, additional areas will be included in the assessment process leading to the RFAs as necessary.

Economic and social implications of RFA options beyond the defined boundary will be taken into consideration in the assessment and planning process and in the discussions concerning mitigation of any adverse impacts.

Private Landholder Participation 
10.

In respect of private land both Governments undertake to encourage and facilitate the active participation of all land owners.

Interim Conservation Arrangements 
11.

Both Governments agree to abide by the commitments as set out in the Interim Forest Agreement signed by the Prime Minister and Premier of Victoria on [Date].

Ecologically Sustainable Forest Management 
12.

The Commonwealth and Victoria agree that ecologically sustainable forest management will require a variety of mechanisms, including: the implementation of a comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) reserve system, complementary off-reserve management, appropriate codes of forest practice and management plans.

Both Governments recognise that an important and integral part of this process is the consideration of economic and social factors in determining and implementing such mechanisms.

The Governments agree to prepare the necessary documents including performance indicators as an integral part of each RFA.

13.

The Governments agree that a CAR reserve system will be developed and implemented as part of the RFA as set out in clause 4 of this Agreement.

Both Governments agree to work with other States, including through the JANIS process toward national CAR reserve criteria using both the Commonwealth's position paper of July 1995 and the NFPS.

14.

While recognising that Victoria has prime statutory responsibility for forest management, both Governments agree to consider jointly the conservation arrangements applicable to both reserves and production areas of forests covered by this agreement as part of the RFA.

15.

Internationally Competitive and Efficient Industries 
16.

17.

In addition to the assistance outlined in clause 15 above, the Commonwealth will provide assistance through its Wood and Paper Industry Strategy and, where necessary, the Structural Adjustment Package, to facilitate implementation of RFA outcomes.

The nature and level of any such assistance will be discussed by both Governments during the course of the RFA in light of economic and social assessments.

18.

Consistent with the NFPS and Competition Principles Agreement signed on 11 April 1995, Victoria agrees to establish by July 1996 a timetable for review (including reporting) of pricing and allocation policies for commercial government owned forestry operations.

Indigenous Issues 
19.

Both governments undertake to consult fully with indigenous communities on all aspects of the RFAs consistent with the requirements of State and Commonwealth legislation.

Accreditation 
20.

It is the objective of both parties that, to the maximum extent possible, data sets and processes be jointly accredited for the purposes of the development, monitoring and assessment of the RFAs and to satisfy the requirements for associated State and Commonwealth statutory assessments (e.g.

the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (the EP(IP) Act)).

ATTACHMENT 1 
COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL ASSESSMENTS (CRAs) 
1.

The Governments recognise each other's statutory, international and policy responsibilities in regard to forests.

The outputs from this assessment will be used to develop options for a CAR reserve system that samples biodiversity in accordance with agreed Commonwealth/State criteria and as input to ecologically sustainable forest management practices in off-reserve system areas.

Outputs will specifically include: 
A data audit report that summarises available information on species, ecosystems/communities, and threatening processes and identifies gaps where additional data collection is required; 
Collection of point location and selected habitat data for flora and fauna and site attributes for defining forest ecosystems and communities; 
Analysis of data to generate forest ecosystems and communities and modelled distributions of flora and fauna species, including an analysis of the performance of data layers as biodiversity surrogates; and 
Inclusion of biodiversity elements in conservation options reports that: 
- develop options for a CAR reserve system; 
- develop management prescriptions for priority species, threatening processes and forest ecosystems and communities in off-reserve areas; and 
- provide recommendations and project outlines for on-going survey and research for inclusion in an RFA.

Outputs will include a full report of the method used, a description of the disturbance categories; maps of the Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVCs), forest growth stages, disturbance classes and old growth at a consistent scale (1:100000); and equivalent digital data covering the entire study area.

Additional information such as better definition of current roading will be incorporated into the analysis.

Outputs will be a map of all areas with wilderness quality and size above agreed thresholds; a map of areas of wilderness quality within the region identifying rational boundaries for protection of wilderness values; and rational boundaries options for wilderness areas.

It will also identify State listed forest species, and, to the extent possible within available funds and resources, implement planning mechanisms in accordance with relevant State legislation.

Key outputs will be programs for recovery plans for species and Threat Abatement Plans for key threatening processes listed under the Commonwealth ESP Act; and action statements, prescriptions and other planning mechanisms for State listed species.

To the extent possible, this identification will be undertaken jointly by the AHC and Victoria in accordance with the criteria for identifying places (Subsection 4(1A) of the AHC Act).

Regional variations in values identified and methodologies utilised may occur in response to the availability and format of data, but, to the extent possible, will be jointly agreed between the AHC and Victoria.

Outputs will include identification, delineation and mapping of national estate values and places; assessment of current levels of protection and identification of conservation principles for the protection of national estate values and places; documentation of agreed methodologies; and documentation sufficient to allow for interim listing on the Register of the National Estate, as appropriate.

The output from this assessment will be an assessment of World Heritage values of the forested areas of Victoria.

Outputs will include identification of areas which are of significance to indigenous groups within a region; documentation of areas which are culturally significant to these groups, according to State heritage legislation and national estate criteria in a format which suits the requirements of both governments and which respects the confidentiality of information regarding areas of Aboriginal significance; assessment of current levels of protection and identification of conservation principles, including on-going consultation with relevant Aboriginal communities; and assessment of Aboriginal community attitudes to forest use.

The main outputs will be agreed data and methods and an assessment of the options.

(Examples are given in Table 2, page 12 of the Commonwealth Economic and Social Assessment discussion paper.)

It will cover issues such as resource availability and sustainability and economic opportunities for forest production including mining, mineral exploration, water production, tourism, and potential for plantation establishment.

It will also develop methods and data to undertake an assessment of industry development and infrastructure options flowing from forested land use options considered in the development of a RFA, and to determine likely economic implications of those options.

Outputs will be an evaluation of the nature of the forest resource (size, quality spatial distribution of products); the current and potential uses of forests and forested land within the Region; sustainability of production flows over time for identified uses/products (including water, recreation) under a range of management regimes and intensities; economic value of products; and the structure and regional significance of the forest products and other industries such as mining and tourism; and industry development and infrastructure options, including resource, infrastructure and policy requirements for the establishment of a range of industries and the resource potential for extending the plantation estate.

These outputs will be based on agreed data and evaluation methods.

This assessment will be seeking to evaluate ecologically sustainable management in the regions through appropriate reserve and off-reserve management.

It will rely to a large extent on other assessments.

Outputs will include review and revision as necessary of forest management systems for native forests to an agreed standard and consistent with the National Forest Policy Statement; agreed baseline environmental standards for forest management; agreement to a future work program for continuing evaluation, review and improvement of management systems; and agreement to projects for information collection and scientific evaluation of management systems.

Consultation and Communication Strategy 
2.

Both Governments recognise that effective community involvement is critical to the successful completion and enduring life of an RFA and therefore agree to prepare and implement a consultation and communication strategy.

Administrative arrangements 
3.

4.

Both Governments agree that any scientific matters on which agreement can not be reached, will be referred to a Joint Scientific Advisory Group (JSAG) at the discretion of the Steering Committee.

The JSAG will report back to the Steering Committee.

Both Governments recognise that referral of matters to the JSAG may have implications for meeting agreed project timelines and significant progress milestones.

Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974

We will carry out the inspection and report as ordered by You in accordance with this agreement and You agree to pay for the inspection and report on delivery of the report.

In ordering the inspection, You agree that the inspection will be carried out in accordance with the following clauses, which define the scope and limitations of the inspection and the report.

INSPECTION.

1.

In the case of Pre-purchase Timber Pest Inspections and all Timber Pest Inspections the inspection will be in accord with the requirements of Australian Standard AS 4349.3-1998 Inspection of buildings Part 3: Timber pest inspections.

2.

In the case of Termite Inspections the inspection will be carried out in accord with AS 3660.2-2000 Termite management Part2: In and around existing buildings and structures.

3.

A copy of these Australian Standards may be obtained from RAPID Solutions at Your cost by phoning (02) 4954 3655 or from Standards Australia.

4.

Termite Inspections are not recommended for pre-purchase inspections.

AS 3660.2-2000 states this and says that the standard that should be used is AS 4349.3-1998.

However, if You request only a Pre-purchase Termite Inspection then the inspection will be in accord with AS 3660.2-2000 and not AS 4349.3-1998.

5.

All inspections (whether in accord with AS 4349.3-1998 or AS 3660.2-2000) will be a non-invasive visual inspection and will be limited to those areas and sections of the property to which Reasonable Access (see definitions below) is both available and permitted on the date and time of Inspection.

6.

The inspector may use a probe or screwdriver to tap and sound some timbers and may use a sharp knife to carry out some `splinter testing' on structural timbers in the sub-floor and/or roof void.

Splinter testing WILL NOT be carried out where the inspection is being carried out for a Client who is a purchaser and not the owner of the property being inspected.

The inspector may use a moisture meter to check moisture levels in walls that back onto wet areas such as showers etc.

Other than these areas the moisture meter will not be used on other surfaces except where the visual inspection indicates that there may be a need to further test the area.

7.

The inspection WILL NOT involve any invasive inspection including cutting, breaking apart, dismantling, removing or moving objects including, but not limited to, roofing, wall and ceiling sheeting, ducting, foliage, mouldings, debris, roof insulation, sarking, sisalation, floor or wall coverings, sidings, fixtures, floors, pavers, furnishings, appliances or personal possessions.

8.

The inspector CANNOT see or inspect inside walls, between floors, inside skillion roofing, inside the eaves, behind stored goods in cupboards, in other areas that are concealed or obstructed.

Insulation in the roof void may conceal the ceiling timbers and make inspection of the area unsafe.

The inspector WILL NOT dig, gouge, force or perform any other invasive procedures.

An invasive inspection will not be performed unless a separate contract is entered into.

9.

If the property to be inspected is occupied then You should be aware that furnishings or household items may be concealing evidence of Timber Pests, which may only be revealed when the items are moved or removed.

In some case the concealment may be deliberate.

If You are the purchaser and not the owner of the property to be inspected then You should obtain a statement from the owner as to any timber pest activity or damage to the property known to them and what, if any, treatments have been carried out to the property.

It is important to obtain copies of any paperwork issued and the details of any repairs carried out.

Ideally the information obtained should be given to the inspector prior to the inspection being conducted.

SCOPE OF THE INSPECTION & REPORT.

10.

In the case of Pre-purchase Timber Pest Inspections or Timber Pest Inspections in accord with AS 4349.3-1998 the Inspection and resulting Report will be confined to reporting on the discovery, or non discovery, of infestation and/or damage caused by subterranean and dampwood termites (white ants), borers of seasoned timber and wood decay fungi (rot), present on the date and time of the Inspection.

11.

In the case of all Termite Inspections in accord with AS 3660.2-2000 inspections the Inspection and resulting Report will.

be confined to reporting on the discovery, or non discovery, of infestation and/or damage caused by subterranean and dampwood termites (white ants) present on the date and time of the Inspection.

Borers of seasoned timber will not be reported on.

Wood decay fungi (rot) will not be reported on but may be reported as a conducive condition for termite activity.

12.

In both cases the Inspection will not cover any other pests and the Report will not comment on them.

Dry wood termites (Family: KALOTERMITIDAE) and European House Borer (Hylotrupes bujulus Linnaeus) will be excluded from the Inspection.

13.

The inspection will report any evidence of a termite treatment that happens to be found.

Where evidence of a treatment is reported then the Client should assume that the treatment was applied as a curative and not as a preventative.

You should obtain a statement from the owner as to any treatments that have been carried out to the property.

It is important to obtain copies of any paperwork issued.

14.

MOULD: Mildew and non wood decay fungi is commonly known as Mould and is not considered a Timber Pest.

However, Mould and their spores may cause health problems or allergic reactions such as asthma and dermatitis in some people.

No inspection for Mould will be carried out at the property and no report on the presence or absence of Mould will be provided.

Should any evidence of Mould happen to be noticed during the inspection, it will be noted in the General Remarks section of this report.

If Mould is noted as present within the property and you are concerned as to the possible health risk resulting from its presence then you should seek advice from your local Council, State or Commonwealth Government Health Department or a qualified expert such as an Industry Hygienist.

LIMITATIONS.

15.

Accordingly the Report will not guarantee that an infestation and/or damage does not exist in any inaccessible or partly inaccessible areas or sections of the property.

Nor can it guarantee that a future infestation of Timber Pests will not occur or be found.

DETERMINING EXTENT OF DAMAGE.

16.

The Report will state timber damage found as 'slight', `moderate', `moderate to extensive' or `extensive'.

This information is not the opinion of an expert, as the inspector is not qualified to give an expert opinion.

The Report will not and cannot state the full extent of any timber pest damage.

An invasive Timber Pest Inspection (for which a separate contract is required) should be carried out and You should arrange for a qualified person such as a Builder, Engineer, or Architect to carry out a structural inspection and to determine the full extent of the damage and the extent of repairs that may be required.

17.

If Timber Pest activity and/or damage are found, within the structures or the grounds of the property, then damage may exist in concealed areas, eg framing timbers.

In this case an invasive inspection is strongly recommended.

Damage may only be found when wall linings, cladding or insulation are removed to reveal previously concealed timber.

You agree that neither We nor the individual conducting the Inspection is responsible or liable for the repair of any damage whether disclosed by the report or not.

COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE
18.

In the event of any dispute or claim arising out of, or relating to the Inspection or the Report, or any alleged negligent act or omission on Our part or on the part of the individual conducting the Inspection, either party may give written Notice of the dispute or claim to the other party.

If the dispute is not resolved within twenty one (21) days from the service of the written Notice then either party may refer the dispute or claim to a mediator nominated by Us.

The cost shall be met equally by both parties or as agreed as part of the mediated settlement.

Should the dispute or claim not be resolved by mediation then one or other of the parties may refer the dispute or claim to the Institute of Arbitrators and Mediators of Australia who will appoint an Arbitrator who will resolve the dispute by arbitration.

The Arbitrator will also determine what costs each of the parties are to pay.

THIRD PARTIES.

19.

The Report will be made solely for the use and benefit of the Client.

No liability or responsibility whatsoever, in contract or tort, is accepted to any third party who may rely on the report wholly or in part.

Any third parties acting or relying on the report, in whole or in part will do so at their own risk.

Note:	In the ACT under the Civil Law (Sale of Residential Property) Act 2003 and Regulations the report resulting from this inspection may be passed to the purchaser as part of the sale process providing it is carried out not more than three months prior to listing and is not more than twelve months old.

DEFINITIONS.

20.

You should read and understand the following definitions of words used in this agreement and the Report.

This will help You understand what is involved in a Timber Pest Inspection or a Termite Inspection, the difficulties faced by an inspector and the contents of the Report with which We will provide You following the inspection.

Access hole means a hole in the structure allowing entry to an area.

Active means the presence of live timber pests at the time of inspection.

If ordered by the client's Agent then it is agreed that the Agent represents the client and has the authority to act for and on behalf of the client.

High moisture readings means a reading on a moisture meter that is higher that the norm for other parts of the structure.

Such high reading should be investigated by invasive means as the presence could indicate a leak or may indicate timber pest activity and damage.

Inactive means the absence of live timber pests at the time of inspection but evidence such as workings, damage, mudding or exit holes is found at the time of the inspection.

NOTE: Where visual evidence of inactive termite workings and/or damage is located, it is possible that termites may still be active in the immediate vicinity and the termites may continue to cause further damage It is not possible, without benefit of further investigation and inspections over a period of time, to ascertain whether any infestation is active or inactive.

Continued, regular, inspections are essential.

Property means the structures, gardens, trees and fences etc up to fifty (50) metres from the exterior walls of the main building but within the boundaries of the land on which the main building is erected.

Unless You specifically order in writing that structures, gardens, trees and fences etc outside the fifty (50) metres from the exterior walls of the main building be inspected no such inspection will be carried out.

The standard defines reasonable access as access to "areas where safe, unobstructed access is provided and the minimum clearances specified in the Table below are available or, where these clearances are not available, areas within the consultant's unobstructed line of sight and within arm's length.

Reasonable access does not include removing screws and bolts to access covers."

Reasonable access does not include the use of destructive or invasive inspection methods.

Nor does reasonable access include cutting or making access traps, or moving furniture or stored goods.

NAME AND DESIGNATION
1.

2.

BACKGROUND

2.1	On 26 December 2004, the Indonesian provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra were devastated by a massive earthquake and resulting tsunami.

In response to this unprecedented disaster, Australia's Prime Minister and Indonesia's President agreed to establish the Australia Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development (AIPRD).

The AIPRD is an AUD 1 billion, 5 year commitment to support Indonesia's reconstruction and development efforts, both in and beyond tsunami-affected areas, through sustained cooperation focused on the Indonesian Government's programs of reform, with an emphasis on economic and social development.

2.2	Since the mid-1990s, AusAID has managed several government sector linkages programs (GSLPs) focusing on partner countries in Asia and the Pacific.

The GSLPs' objectives have been to support small-scale activities that:

a) strengthen partner country institutional capacity in support of a range of agreed developmental objectives; and
b) develop important linkages between Australian Government departments and agencies with their counterparts in Asia and the Pacific.

2.3	As a part of the AIPRD, AusAID will manage a $50 million, 5 year GSLP type mechanism, the Government Partnership Fund (GPF), focusing solely on Indonesia.

The GPF is a flagship of Australia's enhanced partnership with Indonesia and will provide a vehicle for supporting the further development of Indonesia's economic governance and public sector management capabilities.

2.4	The Goal of the GPF is to strengthen the capacity of Indonesian government institutions to implement effective economic, financial and public sector management polices.

The Purpose of the GPF is to exchange skills, knowledge and expertise between Australian government Departments and Agencies and key public sector institutions in Indonesia; and to build long-term institutional linkages and partnerships between Australian public sector institutions and their Indonesian counterparts.

The Customer acknowledges that any part of any money prepaid to Toll by or on behalf of the Customer in connection with the Agreement may be paid to one or more third parties prior to the commencement of the Services.

Subject to the Schedule, ground handling for loading and unloading the Cargo and demurrage charges are included in the Charges.

All other expenses, charges and costs, including, without limitation, in connection with the Cargo, or expenses to comply with any relevant law or regulation or with the requirement of any market, port, airline, customs or excise authority or other person and any duties and taxes and other Governmental Agency charges levied directly on a supply under the Agreement shall be paid for by the Customer in addition to the Charges.

If the Charges or other payments owing to Toll or any of its Related Bodies Corporate are not paid when due, Toll may, without notice to the Customer, remove all or part of the Cargo and store it as Toll thinks fit at the Customer's risk and expense or, except in respect of any amount under an invoice which is genuinely disputed by the Customer, sell all or any of the Cargo as Toll thinks fit and apply the proceeds to discharge the lien and costs of sale without any Liability to any person.

5.

All ground and operating personnel, including any Aircrew, are authorised to take instructions from Toll or any Carrier's Agent only, unless any such rights are delegated in writing by Toll or any Carrier's Agent to the Customer.

Toll or any Carrier's Agent may, but is not obliged to, complete for the Customer any documents required to comply with any laws (but only as authorised to do so by those laws).

Unless otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations, both parties are not responsible for damage or loss as a result of, or arising, directly or indirectly, in connection with, the abovementioned circumstances.

If the Cargo fails to arrive in sufficient time as specified in this clause, Toll or any Carrier's Agent will not be obliged to make any alternative arrangements for the Cargo.

In the event of cancellation pursuant to this subsection, the Cargo shall be returned by Toll to the Customer, its agent or assign, at the Customer's sole cost and expense, to a collection point specified by Toll at the Departure Point.

Toll will make all reasonable effort to reschedule any cancelled Flights or any Flights that fail to commence or if commenced being abandoned due to a fault in the Aircraft or the unavailability of the Aircrew.

6.

The Customer warrants the completeness and accuracy of the information provided to Toll or any Carrier's Agent in the Cargo Manifest and indemnifies Toll for any Liability whatsoever as a result of, or arising out of the Cargo Manifest being inaccurate, incomplete or misleading.

Toll or any Carrier's Agent shall not be responsible for checking or confirming the Customer's disclosures and shall be entitled to rely upon the completeness and accuracy of the Cargo Manifest.

The Cargo Manifest shall be considered a receipt only and not a contract for transportation of the Cargo.

The Customer must insure the Cargo against loss, damage and theft.

Toll reserves the right to request evidence from the Customer as to the currency of the contract of insurance for the Cargo prior to the provision of the Services.

The Customer must, when requested by Toll, promptly satisfy Toll that such contract of insurance is current by producing a certificate of currency.

The Customer indemnifies Toll for any Liability whatsoever as a result of, or arising out of, any breach of the warranties in this clause 6.6, including but not limited to compliance with applicable Dangerous Goods regulations.

7.

For the purpose of these Terms, Toll contracts on its own behalf and also as trustee for each of Toll's Related Bodies Corporate and each Carrier's Agent and, accordingly, may take action in that capacity to recover on behalf of Toll's Related Bodies Corporate and any Carrier's Agent, including in respect of clause 7.

However when the loss, damage or delay of part of the shipment, or of an object contained in the shipment, affects the value of other packages covered by the same airway bill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration when determining the limit of Liability.

8.

9.

A waiver of a right, power or remedy must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver.

The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria.

Each party must pay its own costs in relation to preparation and signing of the Agreement.

Prior to the Transfer Date, the Seller must issue to the Buyer a tax invoice setting out the Sold Commodity to be transferred from the Seller to the Buyer on the Transfer Date, the Unit Price and the total amount payable.

3 Transfer Fees
The Buyer shall pay any transfer fees imposed by the Scheme Rules or applicable registrar in respect of the transfer of the Sold Commodity, including stamp duty, and if the Seller is required by the Scheme Rules to pay any transfer fee or other similar expense associated with the transfer of the Sold Commodity, the Buyer shall reimburse such expense on demand.

4 Payment 
If the Contract Details provide for payment before the Transfer Date, the Buyer shall pay the Unit Price multiplied by the Sold Commodity, by transferring that sum to the Seller's Account on the Payment Date.

If the Contract Details provide for payment on or after the Transfer Date, the Buyer shall pay the Unit Price multiplied by the quantity of Sold Commodity actually delivered for transfer on the Transfer Date, by transferring that sum to the Seller's Account on the Payment Date.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the tax invoice issued under clause 2 does not correctly reflect the quantity of the Sold Commodity actually delivered for transfer on the Transfer Date, the amount required to be paid under this clause shall be adjusted so that the Buyer pays the Seller the Unit Price multiplied by the quantity of the Sold Commodity actually delivered for transfer, and the Seller shall adjust the tax invoice accordingly.

5 Interest
The Buyer shall pay the Seller interest, compounded daily, at the Default Interest Rate on any late payment, from the Payment Date to the date that payment is made.

6 Title
Title to the Sold Commodity transferred in accordance with this Contract will transfer to the Buyer on the Transfer Date (as extended under clause 2, if relevant) or the date determined in accordance with the requirements of the Scheme Rules.

At the time of transfer of the Sold Commodity the Buyer and Seller each warrant to the other that they will comply with the Program or Scheme Rules as relevant as regards the Sold Commodity transferred to the Buyer under this Contract.

Where any amount is payable as a reimbursement, indemnification or similar payment calculated by reference to a loss, cost, expense or other amount incurred, then that amount must be reduced by any input tax credit available to that party and, if a taxable supply, must be increased by the GST payable in relation to the supply and a tax invoice will be provided by the party being reimbursed or indemnified.

Terms defined in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 of Australia have the same meaning when used in this contract.

If a Schedule of Prices has been provided, it shall be used for the purpose of assisting in the determination of progress payments only.

Progress payments will be made as a portion of the Lump Sum commensurate with the amount of Services provided as of the date of invoice.

Schedule of Rates

For work for which the Principal has accepted a Schedule of Rates, the Principal will pay the sum ascertained by multiplying the measured quantity of each item of service actually carried out under the Contract by the rate accepted by the Principal for the item of service, adjusted by any additions or deletions made pursuant to the Contract.

Except where a disbursement has been specifically included in the schedules, the rates are deemed to allow for all supplies, tasks, services, activities, incidentals, overheads, fees and disbursements relating to the item of service listed in the schedule.

No separate payment will be made for any work or expense required for the item of service listed in the schedule but not specifically mentioned in the description of the item of service.

A change in the measured quantity provided does not entitle the Contract to amend the applicable rate.

Upper Limiting Fee

For work for which the Principal has accepted an Upper Limiting Fee, the Principal will pay an amount ascertained on the same basis as a Schedule of Rates, up to the amount of the Upper Limiting Fee.

Payment shall not exceed the Upper Limiting Fee unless the Principal has issued a Variation, in writing, in accordance with Clause 11 "Variations".

At the times specified in the Statement of Requirements, or if no time is specified, monthly, the Contractor shall invoice the Principal in respect of the moneys due for Services satisfactorily performed.

The invoice shall be accompanied by such information and documentation as required by the Principal to verify the invoice.

Subject to the provisions of this Clause, the Principal will pay the Contractor within 30 days of receiving a valid invoice.

If the Contractor's performance of the Services is in breach of this Contract, the Principal may withhold payment of the moneys due for that part of the services not provided in accordance with the Contract.

If payment is to be withheld, the Principal will notify the Contractor within 14 days of the receipt of the Contractor's invoice of its intention to and reasons for withholding payment of the moneys due, or any part thereof.

If the Principal disputes a claim for payment, the Principal will pay any undisputed portion of the invoice.

Payment will not be subject to Rise and Fall.

If the Principal agrees that the variation falls outside the scope of the Services the Principal shall direct the Contractor to prepare a written quotation specifying the cost for the Contractor to carry out the variation.

The Contractor shall not carry out the variation unless the Principal gives the Contractor a written notice accepting the quotation and that written notice will specify the period by which the Expiry Date will be extended.

Both Parties shall carry out the variation accepted by the Principal in accordance with this Contract.

If the variation amounts to a deletion of any part of the Services, the Principal shall give the Contractor written notice of the deletion, any adjustment to the Fee and the Expiry Date.

"Products" means any products or services (where applicable) supplied to Customer by Mobilink Australia and described in Mobilink Australia's invoice;
"Sales Contract" means any sales contract or distribution agreement entered into by Customer and Mobilink Australia in respect of the Products and services supplied to Customer in which these Terms are deemed to be incorporated; and
"Mobilink" means Mobilink Australia (ABN: 63 119 346 253  ).

2) Orders
a.

All orders for Products placed by Customer are subject to acceptance by Mobilink, and no order will be deemed to have been accepted by Mobilink unless Products are supplied or a back-order or delivery delay is confirmed in writing and signed by an authorised representative of Mobilink to Customer.

b. Mobilink may reject any order placed by Customer if there is an insufficient supply of Products which prevents Mobilink from being able to fulfill such order.

c. Mobilink may reject any order placed by Customer for any reason, including, but not limited to incorrect pricing due to typographical errors, market factors or manufacturer price changes 
d. Pricing is not retrospective.

Upon acceptance of Customer's order, the price charged to Customer is the price that is shown at the Mobilink Website checkout or agreed upon by Customer at the time the order was placed.

e. Mobilink will not be bound by any terms attaching to Customer's order and, unless those terms are expressly agreed to in writing by an authorised representative of Mobilink, Customer agrees that those terms are hereby excluded.

3) Payment
a.

The price of the Products will be Mobilink's quoted price.

b.

Payment is required prior to delivery of the Products to Customer unless agreed otherwise in writing by an authorised officer of Mobilink.

c. Mobilink may, in its sole discretion: 
i. suspend the provision of credit to Customer until all amounts owing are paid for in full; and 
ii.

from time to time and at any time, vary or cancel any credit facility it makes available to Customer.

d. Customer will be liable to pay interest on any overdue amount at the annual rate of 2% above the prevailing base lending rate quoted by the National Australia Bank Limited.

Interest will accrue daily from the date payment became overdue until Mobilink has received payment of the overdue amount, together with any interest accrued.

* Design and develop or maintain as appropriate the elements required to implement the work described in the Estimate.

* The Client should note that some features may not be supported by all versions of major browsers and that in these circumstances Sitewise will endeavour to ensure that users with browsers that do not support such features are still able to access the major functionality of The Site.

If the Client requests the incorporation in The Site of features known or discovered during implementation by Sitewise to not be supported by the aforementioned versions of the browser (eg.

Internet Explorer), Sitewise will bring this to the attention of the Client.

* Client agrees that Sitewise may at its discretion place a Sitewise byline on the main page of The Site identifying Sitewise as the designer of The Site or portions thereof, hyperlinked to either an email or Web address of Sitewise.

A Sitewise logo and/or text byline may appear only at or near the bottom of a page.

In relation to third-party Web Search and Indexing organisations, the Client should note that Sitewise has no control over: 

* Whether such third-party organisations actually utilise the information included or submitted to them;
* Whether such third-party organisations accept references to or information about The Site for inclusion in their databases;
* When the third-party organisation might evaluate The Site for inclusion, or;
* When The Site might be included in the third-party organisation's database(s), if approved for listing.

2.

Authorisation
The Client is engaging Sitewise as an independent contractor for the specific project of developing a web site to be installed on the clients web space on an Internet Hosting server.

The client hereby authorises Sitewise to access this account as well as web page directories, cgi-bin directory, and any other directories or programs which need to be accessed for this project.

3.

Exclusions
* Sitewise shall not be responsible for supplying Internet access to the Client.

* Unless otherwise noted in the Estimate, Sitewise does not offer to provide software to the Client.

* Sitewise may contract with third parties in relation to various facilities to be included in The Site.

Sitewise shall not be responsible for the failure of third parties to supply such facilities or the restriction thereof, but will endeavour to rectify such failures or restrictions or make alternate arrangements on behalf of the Client, during the duration of this agreement.

* Third Party providers are used for hosting and domain name registration.

Current terms and conditions of this provider can be found at - http://www.ilisys.com.au/explore/ilisys/terms-and-conditions/
* The Client acknowledges that the network, software and server infrastructure that comprises the Internet is outside the control of Sitewise and Sitewise shall not be held responsible for network, server or other outages, failures or restrictions on supply of services that have negative impacts on The Site.

4.

The Client shall:
* Provide in a timely manner all images, photographs, graphs, charts or other artwork required in finished-quality, hardcopy or electronic format, unless specifically identified in the Estimate;
* Provide in a timely manner all heading, body and caption text required, in either hardcopy or (preferably) electronic format and;
* If this agreement includes a Maintenance Agreement and/or Hosting Agreement, keep the Client's account with Sitewise in a current condition to ensure continuity of service.

5.

Payment Terms
* All hosting charges or requests to register sub-domains or domain names are paid upon Sitewise's request.

These charges will become payable upon implementation of these services.

* Payment in stages may also be required when the site development involves a series of implementation stages from graphics to database construction.

These stages will be outlined in the estimate.

* The balance of the price quoted will be due when the site is posted live to the clients server.

6.

Site Handover
After The Site has been deemed Accepted:

* Sitewise will if necessary publish The Site to its final destination and verify correct working.

* The Client shall note the general comments above regarding limitations to Sitewise's responsibilities in relation to Search Engine listings.

* The Client and Sitewise will arrange a mutually acceptable time for Site Handover.

At Site Handover:

* On request Sitewise will furnish a copy of the backup of display elements on appropriate removable media to the Client.

* Sitewise shall furnish to the Client details of computer accounts and passwords necessary to maintain or control The Site or associated elements, if the Client's Web Hosting package provides such access.

7.

Site Maintenance

* Liaise with hosting providers if required to endeavour to resolve any server- or network-related problems with The Site;
* Carry out updates to The Site at the direction of the Client in a timely manner;
* If required, periodically review statistics (if applicable) and/or The Site generally and advise the Client and;
* Maintain incremental and/or full backups of the computer files comprising the display elements of The Site following changes.

These services will be carried out at an agreed hourly rate, which shall be reviewed annually.

8.

Web Site Hosting
Sitewise may act as a value-added reseller of virtual hosting services.

This means the actual hosting provider bills Sitewise in bulk and Sitewise bills its clients with Hosting Agreements individually.

Clients obtain the benefit of economies of scale and a "one-stop-shop" - Sitewise does all the organisation and setting up for you.

If this agreement incorporates a Hosting Agreement, Sitewise agrees to:

* Discuss the Client's requirements to ensure that a cost-effective, reliable hosting solution is achieved;
* Liaise if necessary with the actual hosting provider to endeavour to resolve any server- or network-related problems with The Site and;
* Keep the virtual host account in good standing with the actual provider whilst the Client keeps his account with Sitewise in good standing.

Because Sitewise may utilise the services of offshore hosting providers in order to maximise cost effectiveness, Hosting Agreements may contain a currency conversion clause.

If applicable this is identified in the Estimate.

This clause allows Sitewise to amend the monthly hosting charge to if exchange rates vary outside the limits identified in the Estimate.

In event of cancellation of the hosting, the setup fee will be retained by Sitewise as well as 20%  or $55 (whichever is lesser) of  the remaining 
12 monthly or 6 monthly hosting term.

9.

Limitation of Liability
Each party specifically agrees that, in no event, shall either party's liability as a result of this agreement and the provision of service hereunder, exceed Client's monthly fee for any single month during which any claim of liability arose or the amount paid for any term agreement.

Neither party shall have liability whatsoever for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages of any kind, including but not limited to, lost revenue and lost profit.

10.

Compliance and Indemnification
Client agrees to use the services provided by Sitewise in compliance with all applicable laws, and to host files or content, if at all, only with the consent of the copyright, trademark, domain name or patent owner.

The Client shall be charged for all costs incurred by Sitewise, including reasonable attorney fees, for any claim, loss, or damage arising out of Client's use or misuse of the Internet or the Services.

The Client specifically agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sitewise, its officers, and employees from any claim, loss, or damage, including costs and reasonable attorney fees, arising out of any act or omission of Client under this Agreement or its use of the Site.

11.

Notices & Amendments
Notice of Acceptance or Termination of this agreement shall be forwarded in writing in person or by regular mail.

Variations and other notices in relation to his agreement shall be in writing and may be forwarded between the parties by electronic mail.

12.

Entire Agreement.

These terms and conditions constitute the entire Agreement with regard to the subject matter hereof and expressly supersede and replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, relating to this Agreement.

This Agreement may be amended by Sitewise at any time without notice, so please check the Sitewise website frequently to review changes.

Any changes or amendments to this Agreement shall be set forth at www.sitewise.com/legal/.

This Agreement is dated:
Between:	<insert name, ACN and address> (the Applicant)
And:	<insert name, ACN and address> (the Respondent)
	(collectively referred to as the Parties)
And:	John Levingston of Level 1, 235 Macquarie Street, SYDNEY NSW 2000 (the Arbitrator)

Whereas:
A	The Parties have agreed to appoint the Arbitrator as the sole arbiter to hear and determine the dispute described in Schedule 1 together with any other dispute or matter arising out of or in relation to the matters in dispute which may be consolidated or otherwise come to be heard together between them (the Dispute).

B	The Arbitrator has agreed to accept this appointment.

The Parties agree as follows:
Entry upon reference
1	By executing (whether as or on behalf of a Party) a counterpart of this Agreement each signatory confirms that Party's agreement to the reference of the Dispute to the Arbitrator as sole arbitrator of the dispute.

2	If the signatory is a legal representative or other agent of a party the signatory:
2.1	warrants to the Arbitrator and to the other Party that the signatory has the actual authority of the signatory's client or principal to execute this Agreement; and
2.2	personally becomes liable for the obligations of the Party for whom the signatory signs, and makes the acknowledgements and agreements made herein by that Party, as if the signatory was a party to this Agreement.

3	The reference is formally entered upon when the Arbitrator executes a counterpart of this Agreement.

4	The Arbitrator is not bound to undertake the reference until he executes this Agreement.

Date & venue
5	The Arbitrator will, in consultation with the Parties, select a date and place for the arbitration and a method of conducting the arbitration, subject to the following:
5.1	In the case of an international commercial arbitration the provisions of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) (IAA) apply; and
5.2	In the case of a domestic arbitration, the provisions of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW) (CAA) apply;
5.3	In the case of an arbitration on documents, the provisions of the Sydney Mediation and Arbitration Rules and terms (SMART) apply.

Fees & Expenses
6	The Arbitrator will charge fees and expenses at the rate set out in Schedule 2, subject to increase from time to time.

7	The Arbitrator will require the Parties to pay his fees and expenses in advance.

8	The Parties are jointly and severally liable for payment of the Arbitrator fees and expenses.

9	The parties will ensure that the Arbitrator is not personally liable for any expenses for the Arbitration.

10	The Parties will pay the Arbitrator's fees and expenses (including payment in advance) as and when requested by the Arbitrator upon receipt of a tax invoice.

11	The Arbitrator may decline to take any step in the Arbitration if any fee or expense is unpaid, without affecting the Arbitrator's rights against the Parties to recover his fees or expenses, including those incurred preparatory to the commencement of this Arbitration.

In particular, any outstanding fees and expenses must be paid before the Arbitrator will release his Award.

12	If any of the Arbitrator's fees or expenses are unpaid after 30 days of the date of the Arbitrator's tax invoice, interest is payable at the rate set out in schedule 5 of the NSW Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.

13	The Arbitrator is not required to provide a tax invoice setting out an itemised narrative for the amount of his fees or expenses.

14	The Arbitrator provides an estimate of his fees and expenses for the arbitration in Schedule 2 (the Estimated Fees and Expenses).

15 	All amounts claimed by the Arbitrator in a tax invoice are monies payable as a debt due to the Arbitrator.

17.3	If monies are held for the Arbitrator in a trust, controlled money or other account of a Party's solicitor, each Party hereby irrevocably authorises and directs the payment of monies from such account immediately on receipt by the solicitor of a tax invoice.

18	This clause does not affect the rights of the Parties as between each other in respect of an award of costs by the Arbitrator.

19	To the extent (if any) that professional services provided by the Arbitrator in respect of the arbitration require disclosure (other than in a bill of costs) and permit the entry into a costs agreement under the Legal Profession Act 2004
	(NSW) or its statutory successors, this Agreement is such a costs agreement and is intended to contain the required terms of disclosure, including a Party's right (if any) to receive a bill of costs and for a review of costs under the Act.

Protection and immunity
20	The Arbitrator has the same protection and immunity conferred on an Arbitrator under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCAA), s53C as if the matter had been referred under s53A of the FCAA.

21	The liability of the Arbitrator is limited by a scheme approved under the Professional Standards Legislation (NSW).

RECITALS:

A.

By agreement dated [insert date] and varied on [insert date] (the Original Commonwealth Agreement) the persons collectively described as "the Researcher" entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth to establish and operate a research centre presently known as the

INTERPRETATION

1.1	In this agreement, unless a contrary intention appears:

	"Deed" means this deed of termination between the Commonwealth and the Researcher;

	"New Commonwealth Agreement" means the agreement referred to in Recital C; "Original Commonwealth Agreement" means the agreement referred to in Recital A; 
	"Unexpended Grant Amount" referred to in clause 4.2, is calculated by multiplying the amount of the monies remaining in the Account by the proportion that the Commonwealth Funding paid by the Commonwealth during the Funding Period bears to the total of the deposits paid into the Account during the Funding Period.

"Recipient" means the company or agent that will sign the New Commonwealth Agreement on behalf of the Extension CRC.

1.2	All capitalised terms in this Deed (other than those defined in clause 1.1) have the same meaning as defined in the Original Commonwealth Agreement.

3.4	For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of the Original Commonwealth Agreement will mean that the Commonwealth is not obliged to make any further payments to the Researcher under the Agreement, including Grant instalments which were to be payable after the termination date.

4.

UNEXPENDED GRANT

4.1	For a period of up to 3 months after the termination of the Original Commonwealth Agreement the Researcher may draw from the Account amounts necessary to meet commitments properly made prior to the termination of the Original Commonwealth Agreement.

The Researcher must comply with any such written directions from the Commonwealth.

4.4	In the event that the Unexpended Grant Amount exceeds $250,000 the Researcher must inform the Commonwealth in writing of the amount of the Unexpended Grant Amount prior to paying any of that amount to the Recipient and must seek written directions from the Commonwealth in regard to its treatment of the Unexpended Grant Amount.

PART 3

EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS
Part 3A   Performance Management and Learning and Development

14.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.

14.1	 The purpose of the Commission's Performance Management Scheme is to strengthen and support the Commission in performing its functions by providing regular and formal assessment of employees' work performance and to provide employees with skill development and career advancement opportunities.

14.2	Participation in, and operation of, the Scheme will be in accordance with the Performance Management Guidelines.

14.5	Employees and supervisors will develop a performance agreement and employees will have their work performance assessed and rated by their immediate supervisors using a four point scale.

Employees will be eligible to advance by one salary point in the relevant classification pay range subject to meeting the performance standard rating of "effective" or better, as set out in the Performance Management Guidelines.

Employees rated "not effective" will not be eligible for salary progression and may be subject to proceedings noted at Clause 16 on "Managing Underperformance".

14.6	Employees who are not satisfied with the supervisor's assessment may request a review of the supervisor's assessment by following the Commission's procedures in respect to review of actions contained in clause 53.8.

14.7	The parties agree to a review of the Commission's Performance Management Scheme to link in with the strategic planning process by 30 June 2009.

15.

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT

15.1	In recognition that training and development can enhance an employee's potential to contribute to the implementation of the strategic plan and to encourage employees to pursue their career aspirations, the parties to this agreement commit to providing opportunities for all employees to participate in relevant learning and development activities.

15.2	The parties to this Agreement will emphasise learning and development activities that:

      (i)	have a clear connection with the work of the Commission; and
      (ii)	have a direct link to individuals' work responsibilities; and
      (iii)	assist ongoing career development.

15.3	The Commission will provide employees with support to access those learning and development activities that will provide the most effective outcomes.

These activities may include on and off the job training and formal study and will be specified in an annual learning and development plan for each employee.

15.4	The parties to this Agreement are committed to adequate learning support to accompany changes, innovations or improvements to work arrangements.

15.5	Studies Assistance

The Commission supports the principle of life long learning and subject to the Studies Assistance Guidelines, employees will be encouraged to undertake tertiary study to improve their career development opportunities.

(i)	Approval for studies assistance is not an automatic entitlement but may be granted subject to operational requirements of the Commission and equity with other employees of the Commission.

(iii)	Employees who have been unable to complete schooling or commence tertiary studies due to personal circumstances will be encouraged to apply for assistance.

(iv)	Where an employee undertakes approved formal studies, the Commission's Studies Assistance Guidelines will apply.

15.6	Reimbursement of Reasonable Expenses When Attending Training
The Commission will, subject to prior approval of such arrangements including the cost, reimburse reasonable additional expenses arising from additional care arrangements when the employee is required to attend a particular training activity outside normal hours of work or away from his or her normal work location.

16.

It is important that these matters be addressed promptly and fairly rather than waiting until the next formal performance management feedback session and any relevant matters must be included in the next formal feedback session if ongoing action is required.

The procedure for handling poor performance set out below applies to all employees except for the following, who are dealt with under the terms of their engagement:

(i)	an ongoing employee who is on probation;

(ii)	a non-ongoing employee who is employed for a specified term or for the duration of a specified task; and

(iii)	a non ongoing employee engaged on an irregular or intermittent basis.

16.2	 This clause sets out the procedure to be observed when, despite attempts to improve performance through the performance feedback scheme and/or other measures, performance still consistently falls below the expected standard.

(i)	A written warning to the relevant employee is to be provided if a performance issue is identified.

(ii)	After the warning is provided the Commission will assess the employee's performance.

A regard for natural justice processes must be observed, including the employee's right to be accompanied by a person of the employee's choosing, and a structured work plan will be developed with the employee.

The structured work plan will be observed over a 2 month period.

(iii)	At the end of the 2 month period the Commission's assessment of whether the employee's performance has met the expected standard of performance and other relevant supporting papers will be given consideration within 7 days.

(iv)	No further action is needed if the assessment is satisfactory.

(v)	If the assessment is unsatisfactory the Commission will write to the employee asking him or her to, within seven days, show cause why further action should not be taken against him or her.

(vi)	The Commission will then consider any cause shown by the employee and the options available.

These options include termination of employment, involuntary termination (retirement) and other actions.

(vii)	An employee, who has received a written warning pursuant to subclause 16.2(i), may voluntarily request in writing to be retired at any time during this process.

The Commission will decide whether or not to retire the individual on receiving such a request.

The entitlement of an individual who voluntarily requests termination of employment (retirement)  and is voluntarily retired is the same as voluntary retrenchment without the severance pay.

(viii)	This procedure does not prevent an employee from pursuing an appropriate claim before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or any other tribunal established by law.

Part 3B Classification, Pay Rates and Remuneration Arrangements

17.

INCREASES IN RATES OF PAY

17.1	The remuneration framework established in this Agreement provides for the following average percentage increases to the rates of pay applying prior to the certification of this Agreement:

(i)	4% from 8 January 2009, or from certification whichever is the later;
(ii)	4% from 7 January 2010.

(iii)	4% from 6 January 2011
.

* Cross Commission collaborative working arrangements enabling the Commission to harness valuable specialist expertise and to use that to improve or enhance projects or activities.

* Increased flexibility in work practices including extension of the bandwidth, introduction of broadbanding and the development of workplace flexibility principles.

* Implementation of an electronic travel diary to streamline the interstate travel arrangements of the Complaint Handling Unit.

* Rationalisation of the Commissions contracts for art work.

* 0.5% from 1 July 2009;
* 0.5% from 1 July 2010; and
* 0.5% from 1 July 2011.

These salary increases will only be delivered if they are within the Commission's budgetary capacity to pay without sustaining employee losses and expected productivity savings are achieved.

In the event, due to budgetary constraints, an increase is unable to be delivered on any of the July pay dates, the Commission will review its capacity to deliver that increase in addition to the subsequent increase at the following 1 July date.

These increases will not be backdated.

18.

CLASSIFICATION STRUCTURE AND REMUNERATION

18.1	The range of duties assigned to each position, and the employees engaged to perform them, shall be allocated an approved APS classification within classification structure included at Appendix A.

18.2	Where an employee commences employment with the Commission, or is moved or promoted to a position in the Commission, salary will be payable at the minimum salary point applicable to the employee's position classification unless the Commission authorises payment above the minimum point in that salary range having regard to the skills, qualifications, experience, market considerations and equity with other employees.

The Commission may authorise payment above the maximum point of the salary range, where immediately prior to commencing with the Commission, the employee was in receipt of salary above the maximum point in the current salary range.

18.3	The Commission may approve the movement from APS1 to APS2 and APS3 to APS4 as a broadband following the successful completion of performance competency assessment in conjunction with the Commission's Performance Management Scheme and subject to work availability.

18.4	Advancement subject to the Performance Management Scheme: Advancement through the pay points of the employee's position classification shall be in accordance with the provisions of the performance management scheme.

18.5	Incorrect Salary Point: Where, at the time of engagement, an employee's salary is set at an incorrect salary point within the applicable salary scale the Commission may authorise in writing the payment of the correct salary point.

18.6	Reversion: Where an employee requests in writing to perform work at a lower work value level the Commission may determine in writing that the employee shall be paid a rate of salary applicable to the lower work value position classification.

18.7	Irregular or Intermittent Employees: Non-ongoing employees who are employed on an irregular or intermittent basis for less than full time hours per week may be paid an additional loading of 20% of salary in lieu of an entitlement to conditions specified for other employees.

Irregular and intermittent employees are entitled to long service leave under the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.

19.

Part 3C    Flexible Work Arrangements and Work Life Balance

25.

WORK/LIFE BALANCE
The Commission acknowledges that employees have to balance their working life with other commitments, including family and the community.

This is recognised through the provision of a range of flexible attendance arrangements, leave provisions and assistance programs.

When applying flexible attendance arrangements and other employment conditions, the Commission and its employees will consider the operational needs of the Commission and any effect on other employees to ensure equitable outcomes.

The Commission's Workplace Flexibility Principles support flexible working arrangements across the agency.

(Appendix C)

Employees may request flexible working conditions subject to the Commission's Workplace Flexibility Principles.

26.

PART-TIME REQUESTS

HOURS OF WORK

27.1	The Commission recognises the importance of having a balance between work and personal/family responsibilities and will not require an employee to work unreasonable hours of work.

No employee is expected to work excessive hours as a matter of course.

It is recognised that some employees will need to work extra hours from time to time in order to meet deadlines and deal with unexpected contingencies.

The working of excessive hours in such circumstances should be discussed with the supervising manager before doing so, so as to confirm the operational necessity for working excessive hours.

Managers and employees will use available working arrangements to minimise the working of excessive hours.

27.2	Standard hours:	Standard hours of work shall be 147 hours in each four week settlement period.

27.3	Standard Hours and Bandwidth:  Standard hours shall be worked within the bandwidth of 7:30am to 6.30pm, Monday to Friday.

A standard day is 8.30am to 4.51pm with an hour for lunch between 12.30pm and 1.30pm.

27.4	Notwithstanding subclause 27.3, standard hours may be worked outside of the bandwidth stipulated where an employee and the Commission so agree and where operational requirements may be met.

The Commission recognises the importance of employees achieving a balance between work and personal life and acknowledges that many employees have carer responsibilities.

Where operational and security requirements permit, the Commission will favorably consider requests to work standard hours outside the bandwidth.

Supervisors at the EL 2 level may approve their employees to work outside the bandwidth hours subject to the above requirements and in consultation with the Personnel Manager.

Supervisors and employees should agree on a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding hours of work that recognises operational considerations.

Agreement should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they are operating effectively.

Where agreement cannot be reached over a request to work outside the bandwidth times it may be referred to the Personnel Manager or Executive Director for resolution.

27.5	Core hours:	Core hours will be 10.00am to 12.00pm and 2.00pm and 4.00pm unless varied by agreement by an employee and their supervisor based on operational needs.

Employees shall ordinarily be present at work during core hours.

27.7	Start and finish times:  Starting and finishing times within the bandwidth are to be determined by the Commission, after consultation with employee/s.

To optimise effective client service supervisors may require employees (including part-time employees where this is consistent with their ordinary hours) to attend at specific times during general business hours of 8.30am to 5pm.

It is understood that these arrangements should provide employees flexibility to balance work and personal obligations subject to operational requirements of the Commission, the need for appropriate supervisory arrangements to be in place and Occupational Health and Safety principles.

27.8	Reimbursement for Family Care Arrangements: Where the Commission requires employees to be away from home outside bandwidth hours (including normal travel time) or to work outside their regular hours managers will approve payment or reimbursement of the reasonable cost of additional family care arrangements on the production of receipts.

In accessing flexleave:

(i)	An employee may not have an accrual in excess of 25 hours flexleave at the conclusion of any settlement period.

Excess flex leave should be utilised in the period that it accrues.

Any excess will be reduced automatically to 25 hours at the end of the settlement period.

The purpose of flex leave is to provide flexibility in work patterns over a regular period and not to build up excessive credits to be used in conjunction with annual leave.

Where there are periods of high workloads, Managers will retain the discretion to allow accrual in excess of 25 hours as long as this additional carryover is used within the next settlement period.

(ii)	An employee may not have a debit of flexleave in excess of 10 hours at the conclusion of any settlement period.

(iii)	Periods of absence shall be taken at such times and in such periods as are agreed between the employee and the Commission.

If a manager identifies that an employee is working excessive hours, they will review staffing and work arrangements in the relevant area to establish whether alternative arrangements are available (eg overtime).

27.11 	Where an employee fails to comply with the provisions of flextime a supervisor may recommend to the Executive Director or delegate that the employee be removed from the flextime scheme for a specified period.

The employee would revert to working standard hours for the specified period.

Executive Level 1 employees where they have chosen not to access flexleave shall be covered by this clause.

The parties to this agreement acknowledge that the remuneration for Executive Level employees incorporates a component to compensate for the extra demands which may be placed on such employees, including working beyond standard hours.

It is expected that Executive level employees will negotiate flexibility in working hours to balance work and personal requirements with the Commission.

(ii) 	In the interest of achieving a balance between work and personal life the Commission does not expect that employees at the Executive Level work unreasonable hours.

It is agreed that managers have a responsibility to minimise the extent to which Executive Level employees are required to work excessive hours.

Strategies to reduce the need to work unreasonable hours include reviewing workloads, priorities and work practices.

(iii) 	Executive Level employees also have the flexibility to manage their own workloads in consultation with their managers.

The Commission expects that Executive Level employees will be able to responsibly manage their hours to meet operational requirements.

(iv) 	It is acknowledged that there may be variations in workloads for Executive Level employees through the year.

It is recognised that at times Executive Level employees may be required to work extended hours during peak workload periods during the week and weekends but that this should not be for lengthy periods.

Where it is foreseen that there will be an increase in workload this is to be raised with the supervisor as early as possible and in advance to address any issues including work priorities and appropriate time off in lieu  (TOIL) .

It is expected that any TOIL arrangements be agreed to at the time of the increased work load but it is acknowledged that there may be unforeseen circumstance that arise .

It is desirable that Executive Level employees be able to access TOIL as soon as possible, subject to operational requirements.

Where agreement cannot be reached between an employee and their manager it may be referred to the Personnel Manager or Executive Director to resolve.

27.13	Absences without approval:	Where an employee is absent from duty without approval, all pay and other benefits provided under this agreement, eg flextime, will cease to be available until the employee resumes duty or is granted leave.

Where flextime no longer applies, employees will revert to standard hours (as defined in this clause).

27.14	Domestic Travel time during bandwidth hours:  Employees who are on flextime under clause 27.10 may claim domestic business related travel time during the bandwidth hours as flextime.

28.

Approval for an on-going home based work arrangement may be conditional upon an employee's willingness to meet costs associated with necessary modifications to the home based site.

The arrangement may only be approved where it is capable of implementation at minimal or no cost to the Commission.

Any request for remote access at home or other locations is to be approved by the Executive Director.

Where the Commission has decided to terminate an arrangement, the employee concerned shall be given reasonable notice of the termination.

However, an arrangement may be approved by the Commission in exceptional circumstances for an employee to work from home while recovering from an injury or having responsibility for another person who needs care.

To support employees  in these responsibilities the Commission will engage the services of a family support service.

These services will assist employees with information and resources across a range of family and carer matters.

32.

The three month period is in calendar days and will be non-cumulative.

All approvals will be subject to operational requirements and the negotiation of a mutually agreeable period of absence.

Where it is of direct benefit to the work of the Commission and the career development of the employee it will count as service.

33.

Financial assistance of up to $500 will be provided for access to retirement seminars and/or superannuation and financial advice.

Transition arrangements may vary between individuals as both individual and operational needs are considered but may include access to part-time work (refer clause 26 for part-time provisions) and/ or changes in work level or responsibilities by agreement.

Appointment of Mediator 
1.

The parties appoint the mediator to mediate in accordance with the terms of 	this agreement the dispute between them.

The dispute is briefly described in 	Schedule 1 to this Agreement (the "Dispute").

The mediator accepts the 	appointment to mediate the Dispute at a time and place agreed to by the parties 	and set out in Schedule 2 to this Agreement.

Role of the Mediator 
2.

The mediator will be neutral and impartial.

The mediator will assist the parties 	to attempt to resolve the dispute by helping them to: 
	?

?systematically isolate the issues in dispute; 
	?

?develop options for the resolution of these issues; 
	?

?explore the usefulness of these options; and 
	?

?meet their interests and needs.

3.

The mediator may meet with the parties together or separately.

4.

The mediator will not: 
	?

?give legal or other professional advice to any party; or 
	?

?impose a result on any party; or 
	?

?make decisions for any party.

5.

The mediator will not accept an appointment or act for any party in relation to 	any proceedings concerning the Dispute.

6.

Neither party will take action to cause the mediator to breach Clause 5.

Conflicts of Interest 
7.

The mediator must, prior to the commencement of the mediation, disclose to 	the parties to the best of the mediator's knowledge any prior dealings with any 	of the parties as well as any interest in the Dispute.

8.

If in the course of the mediation the mediator becomes aware of any 	circumstances that might reasonably be considered to affect the mediator's 	capacity to act impartially, the mediator must immediately inform the parties 	of these circumstances.

The parties will then decide whether the mediation 	will continue with that mediator or with a new mediator appointed by the 	parties.

Co-Operation by the Parties 
9.

The parties must co-operate with the mediator and each other during the 	mediation.

Conduct of the Preliminary Conference 
10.

As part of the mediation the mediator will schedule a preliminary conference 	at a time and venue convenient to the parties to establish a timetable for the 	mediation.

This is useful for cross-referencing pre-existing IP with developed IP.

iii Details of registration to be recorded include but are not limited to the form of IP (eg a trade mark), jurisdiction (eg Australia), date of registration and date of expiry.

iv It is acceptable to include a range of dates if there is no one identifiable date - eg 1-4/08/06.

v This column is used to record any licensing, publication, release or dissemination of works in which Project IP exists - eg publication of a report in a journal; provision of IP to a contractor.

BOOKMARK NOT DEFINED.

1 TitleThis Agreement shall be known as the Victorian Council of Social Service Enterprise Agreement 2006.

2 Scope and ApplicationThis agreement shall be binding upon VCOSS and the Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (ASU) in respect of all persons who are eligible to join the ASU (whether members or not).

All employees excluding the CEO, including people employed in projects auspiced by VCOSS, shall be employed in accordance with the conditions of employment as stated in this agreement.

3 Date of OperationThis Agreement shall operate from 1 July 2006 and shall operate until 30 June 2009.

The Agreement as varied and extended shall operate from the date of the order of Fair Work Australia and reach its nominal expiry date on 30 June 2012.

In the event of any inconsistency between the incorporated award terms and the other terms of this agreement, the agreement prevails to the extent of the inconsistency, so far as the terms exceed the minimum entitlement set by the Award.

In the event that a term in this agreement fails to meet the basic Award entitlement, the Award entitlement will prevail.

Further, the parties agree that no employee shall be employed other than under the terms of this agreement.

The terms and conditions of the agreement shall be incorporated into the contract of employment of employees bound by this agreement.

5 Implementation of AgreementA Joint Consultative Committee will oversee the implementation of the agreement, in cooperation with the Human Resources staff and the Management Team.

In implementing this agreement, VCOSS will consult with its employees on a particular matter by:?

Sharing relevant information with the employees affected by the matter; and?

Giving the employees affected by the matter a reasonable opportunity to express their views; and?

Taking into account those views; and?

Involving the JCC representatives in the consultation.

Such consultation must take place in a timely manner.

The JCC will:?

Facilitate staff engagement, consultation and communication in relation to the implementation of this agreement;?

Review proposed organisational change where it impacts on the implementation of this agreement;?

Participate in the development of policies relating to employment matters; and?

Be involved, as requested, in dispute resolution proceedings in accordance with clause 16 Dispute Resolution of this agreement.

The JCC will meet at least quarterly.

JCC representatives shall be allowed reasonable time to prepare and participate in the workings of the JCC and shall be adequately trained through an agreed process to perform their role in paid work time.

The JCC shall consist of:a. the CEO, andb. one staff member per each 15 employees, or part thereof, elected by the staff body, andc. one union representative, elected by ASU members of staff.

Changes to the representatives serving on the JCC will be subject to consultation with and agreement from the staff body.

Elected positions are subject to re-election every twelve (12) months.

It is preferred that elected positions are representative of the diversity of roles within VCOSS.

This shall be undertaken in the following ways:?

Exploring methods to increase the security of the employees' employment;?

Increasing investment in the productive capacity of the organisation;?

Giving preference to the internal workforces in any competitive tendering/contracting out process;?

Establishing agreed fixed minimum hours of employment for permanent part time or casual employees.

Where agreement has been reached between the parties the agreed arrangements will form a supplementary agreement which shall be certified in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under the provisions of Schedule 7, Part 2 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996/or any relevant subsequent legislation.

The following types of behaviour, where repeated or occurring as part of a pattern, could be considered bullying:?

Verbal or written abuse?

Excluding or isolating employees?

Psychological or physical harassment?

Intimidation?

Assigning meaningless tasks unrelated to the job?

Giving employees impossible assignments?

Deliberately changing work rosters to inconvenience particular employees?

For the avoidance of doubt, no clause in this agreement relates to the employment of the CEO.

This method is appropriate for short term or temporary positions, or where it is reasonable to expect that there will not be any internal interest in the position.

Fixed term employment may be on a full time or part time basis.

An employee employed on a full time basis will be entitled to the full benefits of this agreement.

Harassment may take the form of, but is not limited to:?

Sexism?

Racism?

Favouritism?

Victimisation?

Coercion?

Jokes or innuendo?

Torment, intimidation, abuse or assault.

6.10 Human Resources staffThose employees who have primary responsibility for the Human Resources function at VCOSS from time to time.

6.11 Internal employeeAn internal employee is:?

Any employee, volunteer or student intern who was dismissed by VCOSS will not be deemed to be an internal employee.

Any employee who has been made redundant and/or been paid a severance payment by VCOSS will not be deemed to be an internal employee.

6.12 Management TeamThe VCOSS senior management group as constituted from time to time and currently comprising Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Director, Policy Manager, Sector Development Manager, Membership & Communications Manager and Business & Development Director.

In relation to an employee they manage, the members of the team are referred to individually as 'their manager' or 'the relevant manager'.

6.13 Near relative?

A spouse, partner or de facto partner; or?

A dependant child; or?

A parent or step-parent (or parent-in-law); or?

A sibling or a sibling of the employee's partner; or?

A grandparent or step-grandparent (or grandparent-in-law); or?

Another relative or close personal friend or other relevant person as agreed between VCOSS and the employee.

Employees working on a part time basis are entitled to the benefits of this agreement on a pro rata basis, except where otherwise stated.

6.15 Performance Development and Management ProgramVCOSS is committed to a collaborative approach between managers and employees which provides a regular avenue for giving and receiving feedback.

In order to achieve this, VCOSS has introduced a Performance Development and Management Program which governs:?

Annual work plans;?

Individual career goals;?

Identification of training and development needs; and?

Regular meetings and feedbackFor further information refer to the Performance Development and Management Program Policy, as amended from time to time.

6.16 Probation periodAn agreed period at the commencement of an employee's employment with VCOSS during which time the employment can be terminated by VCOSS if the employee's performance is not satisfactory.

6.17 Short-term vacancyA vacancy of thirteen (13) weeks or less.

6.18 VCOSS policiesDocumented and approved protocols covering particular internal processes at VCOSS.

Such policies may be referred to throughout this agreement.

They do not form part of this agreement and VCOSS retains the right to vary such policies from time to time.

VCOSS recognises that some people are affected by disadvantage or discrimination in employment and will take active steps to ensure employment policies and practices enable the workplace to remain free from discrimination and harassment.

This commitment to achieving equality of employment opportunity applies to all phases of employment, including but not limited to, selection and appointment of personnel, promotion, training, superannuation, compensation benefits and terms and conditions of employment.

VCOSS will also provide appropriate support and flexibility to deliver on this commitment.

All discriminatory behaviour is undesirable, may be unlawful and will not be tolerated.

VCOSS expects that all employees, volunteers and student interns will take responsibility for fair, non-discriminatory behaviour.

Any reports of discrimination against an employee will be treated seriously by VCOSS, and will be investigated thoroughly and confidentially.

These will be made available to all employees.

Position descriptions will be reviewed at least annually as part of the Performance Development and Management Program, in order to ensure that the position description reflects the current duties of the role.

The position description shall not be altered by VCOSS except with the written consent of the employee.

Position descriptions may be reviewed and altered prior to the appointment of a new employee to a vacant position in consultation with Human Resources staff.

Position descriptions will be made available to all potential applicants when advertising a vacancy.

This can be undertaken by calling for either expressions of interest (EOI) or applications.

All advertisements and expressions of interest for vacant positions will be circulated to all internal employees.

EOIs should: ?

be circulated to all internal employees via email; and?

be additionally circulated to employees who will be absent during the response time; and?

give a minimum response time of 48 hours; and?

clearly state what response is expected, ie how an employee is to express their interest; and?

allow additional time after close of response time to complete an application, where applicable.

With the exception of a short-term vacancy as defined in clause 6.17 Short-term vacancy, if an internal selection procedure is not successful, vacancies will then be advertised externally.

All proposed new appointments must be approved by the CEO.

Position descriptions must be made available to all potential applicants.

VCOSS PartnershipsVCOSS is often involved with other organisations to form cross-organisational or cross-sectoral collaborations.

From time to time, employment opportunities arise from these bodies, which therefore means VCOSS is not the sole agency with a stake in the position, despite the position being housed and managed at VCOSS.

These situations may include, but are not limited to situations where:?

the other party/parties has provided funding or other significant resources to support the creation of the position; or?

VCOSS is party to a memorandum of understanding or other formal agreement.

In such situations, where the other party requests, it is reasonable to advertise the position through external sources, particularly through the networks of the other stakeholders, whilst advertising internally at VCOSS.

Interview panels for all positions covered by this agreement will consist of:?

The relevant manager/project co-ordinator of proposed position (Panel Co-ordinator); and?

A JCC representative or other relevant member of staff agreed in consultation with the JCC; and?

One non-management member of the Team or Project and/or independent person with expertise in the field.

Each of the above members may choose to delegate their authority to a coopted person who has relevant skills to enable them to act on behalf of the delegating member.

Interview panels will not exceed four members.

8 Status of EmploymentAt the time of engagement, VCOSS will provide the employee with written advice of the terms of their employment, specifying whether they are full time, part time or casual and the duration of the contract where applicable.

The letter of offer should also outline the employee's classification and rate of pay and any other information relevant to the employment agreement.

An employee employed on a full time basis will be entitled to the full benefits of this agreement.

Employees working in a full time capacity have the option to negotiate the change to a part time position.

Acknowledging that the organisation's operational needs will be taken into account, such requests shall not be unreasonably refused.

Employees working on a part time basis are entitled to the benefits of this agreement on a pro rata basis.

where the employee works from home by agreement with their manager; or?

in exceptional circumstances with the agreement of VCOSS.

Any additional hours worked under such a contract, will be included in the pro rata calculation for the employee's entitlements.

temporary relief or replacement employees; or?

short term, intermittent or irregular employment; or?

positions where it is not possible or practical to offer additional work to existing part time employees; or?

situations where specialist skills are required, which are not continuing, and would not be anticipated to be met by existing employees.

An employee engaged on a casual basis shall be paid the hourly rate as defined by their position description, plus a loading of twenty-five percent (25%) in lieu of paid leave and public holidays.

If a fixed term employee is subsequently appointed to an ongoing position with VCOSS, any period of the fixed term contract completed immediately prior to the commencement of the permanent position shall be recognised as service with VCOSS for the purpose of calculating leave entitlements, pursuant to clause 8.11 Continuity of Service provided that the employee has not taken or received a redundancy payment.

A fixed term employee will be paid severance pay if their employment contract ends and they have been employed by VCOSS for more than 2 years.

VCOSS will not enter into additional contractual arrangements with existing employees.

Job sharing must be negotiated prior to engagement in the instance of new employment, or with the relevant manager for existing employees.

Work plans, including the division of specific tasks, responsibilities and accountability pertaining to the position, will be developed with the relevant manager.

Job share employees will have a responsibility to ensure that a high level of continuity exists between the two positions, including ensuring a handover period on a regular basis.

In the event that either employee in a job share position resigns or is dismissed, their position will be offered to the incumbent in the first instance.

If this offer is not taken up, the vacant hours shall be filled in accordance with clause 7 Recruitment.

Secondment to VCOSSVCOSS may second an employee when particular expertise is required from outside the organisation.

A secondment can be filled as a short term vacancy as per clause 7 Recruitment, however a secondment does not need to be internally advertised.

Employment conditions and contracts will be negotiated between employers and the seconded employee on a case by case basis.

Secondment of a VCOSS employeeA request for secondment to another position outside the organisation should be made to the relevant manager in the first instance.

The final decision will take into account the burden to VCOSS in filling the vacant position, the time frame in question, staff development potential and the importance of sharing expertise within the sector.

As in other similar leave applications, an employee on secondment will have their position held open for them during their absence, subject to funding.

The decision to replace an employee on secondment is at the discretion of the relevant manager, taking into consideration the workload of the team and any other concurrent employee absences.

Employment conditions and contracts will be negotiated between employers and the seconded employee on a case by case basis.

Secondment within VCOSSA secondment may occur from time to time within VCOSS.

A secondment may be appropriate to staff a short term position that has a fixed ending or where VCOSS needs to temporarily redirect resources.

If an employee is seconded to another position within VCOSS, their original position will be held open for them to return to once the secondment has been completed.

The normal internal advertising process will apply for positions eligible for secondment.

When a suitable candidate has been selected, the request to second should be made to the relevant manager and the decision will take into account the time frame in question, staff development potential and operational needs.

The decision to replace an employee on secondment is at the discretion of the relevant manager, taking into consideration the workload of the team and any other concurrent employee absences.

both parties are in agreement with regards to the proposed changes; and?

the proposed changes do not breach any of the terms contained within the agreement; and?

operational requirements have been taken into account and both parties are satisfied that the proposed changes do not adversely affect other employees or the organisation.

8.10 RedeploymentWhere an existing VCOSS employee has been informed by VCOSS that their position is to be made redundant, the relevant manager will explore the possibility of redeploying that employee to an alternative position within VCOSS which is vacant or expected to arise, and which the relevant manager deems suitable for that employee given the employee's experience, knowledge and qualifications.

VCOSS will make reasonable endeavours to retrain such an employee so they can be redeployed into a vacant role within VCOSS.

However, the parties acknowledge that in some circumstances it will not be feasible for an employee to be retrained to perform a particular role.

This panel will conduct an interview and may carry out a reference check and/or review of recent performance appraisal, in order to determine whether the employee has the skills to perform the vacant role and/or whether they could perform that role after retraining.

After completing this investigation, the panel will make a recommendation to the relevant manager as to whether the employee can perform the vacant role.

If the panel's recommendation is that the employee cannot perform the vacant role, it will make a further recommendation to the relevant manager as to whether retraining is a feasible option to enable the employee to perform the role.

If the relevant manager, or other authorised officer of VCOSS, determines that retraining is feasible, the retraining option will be explored and implemented with the employee.

If the number of redundant employees is greater than the number of vacant positions, an interview process conducted by VCOSS based on merit will form the basis of VCOSS's selection.

A position description will be made available to all applicants prior to interview.

8.11 Continuity of ServiceFor the purposes of calculating an employee's entitlements under this agreement, continuity of service is not broken:?

if VCOSS continues to employ, or re-employs within 6 months, an employee who has completed a fixed term contract; or?

by an absence on unpaid leave approved by VCOSS; or?

if an employee has been seconded to another employer.

The period of the break in service does not count toward the accrual of entitlements.

Continuity of service is broken where severance pay is paid.

Any permanent or regular adjustment to these hours needs to be agreed upon with the relevant manager and approved by the CEO.

The spread of hours for work at VCOSS is 7.00am until 7.00pm Monday to Friday.

Employees may manage their own hours of work, provided that they work no more than a ten (10) hour day.

Hours of work outside the hours of 7.00am until 7.00pm and on weekends must be approved by the relevant manager.

All employees are considered to be responsible professionals and therefore able to organise their time flexibly to balance their personal needs, occupational wellbeing and the operational needs of the organisation.

The purpose of these flexible hours is to enable employees to tailor their work around personal commitments and to work extra hours to take a day off from time to time.

Employees are thereby to negotiate their hours (including outside office hours) with their manager and team members.

Every employee working a full day, however defined, shall be entitled to at least two fifteen (15) minute paid breaks from duty additional to their lunch break so as to allow physical relaxation and regeneration of concentration levels.

Employees working less than a full day shall have a pro-rata entitlement.

Employees are required to complete their time sheets on a daily basis to ensure that all working hours and breaks are recorded accurately.

The additional leave is paid for via a corresponding reduction in fortnightly pay spread out evenly over the course of the year.

The employee effectively takes four weeks of leave without pay but can spread the salary impact of it over 26 pay periods.

To be eligible for a flexible work year arrangement, an employee must have at least twelve (12) months of future service available under their current employment contract.

A flexible work year arrangement must apply for at least a whole year.

Periods greater than a year must be in multiples of six months.

An application must be made:?

by 15 December to apply for the following calendar year; or?

by 30 June to apply for the following financial year; or?

upon commencement of employment to apply for a year from commencement date.

An employee can apply for a flexible work year arrangement for reasons including, but not limited to:?

childcare during school holidays;?

other caring responsibilities;?

taking an extended holiday;?

family commitments;?

study commitments;?

other personal circumstances.

For further information refer to the Flexible Work Year Policy, as amended or varied from time to time.

VCOSS will allow employees to take proportionate time off in lieu of payment of overtime.

Time-in-lieu is accrued at the rate of time and a half for the first two hours and double time thereafter.

Time-in-lieu is to be used to manage overtime worked by an employee at the request of VCOSS.

Flexi-time provisions are to be used to manage time within the normal spread of hours.

Time-in-lieu may be granted for purposes including, but not limited to:?

Rural work, or?

Running conferences out of the normal spread of hours, at weekends or on public holidays, or?

Attending evening or weekend workshops, meetings conferences or functions, or?

Casual employees will receive wage equivalent, or?

Peak periods of work as agreed with the relevant manager, or?

Approved professional development outside of normal working hours, or ?

Other activities as directed by the relevant manager from time to time.

Where possible, all time-in-lieu must be authorised by the relevant manager before it is accumulated.

Time-in-lieu should be recorded on the employee's time sheet as accrued.

Time-in-lieu must be discussed with the relevant manager and approved accordingly.

VCOSS is obligated to review working hours and an employee's workload as part of the Performance Development and Management Program.

As part of this process, employees who have accrued excessive hours of time-in-lieu should be assisted with a plan to reduce the accrued hours and to ensure that the employee's workload is manageable within their specific working hours.

The payment of accrued time-in-lieu is not a standard practice at the time of resignation.

However, it is open to negotiation between the employee and the CEO taking into consideration VCOSS's operational requirements and the obligations under the Performance Development and Management Program as detailed above.

Any time worked outside the normal spread of hours is time-in-lieu for which authorisation is required.

Employees may elect to use the flexi-time system to work up a day off (or part of a day).

However, VCOSS aims to provide a comfortable and safe workplace, and all efforts are made to create an environment which is conductive to meeting employment obligations and which is worker friendly.

Employees wishing to work at home must reach agreement with their manager.

Agreement should be based on specific task allocation.

When working at home, employees are required to notify reception, giving details of when they will be back in the office and a number where they can be contacted if required.

Authorisation to work at home may be sought in the following circumstances:?

Work environment is unsatisfactory (this may mean that the employee does not have their own desk and phone, they may share an office and need quiet time to write);?

Employee has impending deadlines and needs to commit solid time, without interruption, to one project;?

Family commitment where other arrangement cannot be made;?

Air conditioning or power failure, or other necessary amenities at office are not working.

Any pre-determined working at home time should be discussed with the relevant manager.

Work done at home shall be monitored, according to agreement between parties concerned.

In reaching agreement regarding working at home, the relevant manager must take into consideration the employee's obligations at the office (e.g.

attending staff meetings, answering calls etc.)

in order to minimise the impact of their absence on other employees, and ensure that all teams are appropriately staffed.

10 LeaveEmployees are entitled to the following leave entitlements in accordance with the employment status as outlined in clause 8 Status of Employment.

Part time employees will receive the entitlements pro rata.

the average number of hours worked in the twelve (12) months prior to taking leave; or?

If an employee is on a period of paid leave at the time when a new or varied agreement takes effect, and the entitlement to that type of leave is increased by the implementation of the new or varied agreement, then the employee will receive the higher entitlement effective under the new or varied agreement.

This is paid when the leave is taken.

During the first, second, third and fourth years of employment, 14 working days in each year; and?

Thereafter, 21 working days in each year.

No more than ten (10) single days in any one year may be taken without the production of a medical certificate.

Sick leave on either side of a Public Holiday will not be paid without a medical certificate.

This may be taken either from their own sick leave entitlement, or as unpaid leave if they have used up their own entitlement.

The relevant manager is to be notified of any application for bereavement/compassionate leave.

This leave may not be accrued.

Employees will be required to use all personal leave entitlements prior to making an application for Exceptional Circumstances Leave.

Personal and family leave may be taken for reasons such as, but not limited to:?

Traditional or customary leave; or?

Caring for a near relative; or?

Attending to the education of a dependent child; or?

Moving house; or?

Volunteering;where these tasks cannot reasonably be performed outside working hours and where alternative arrangements are either inappropriate, unavailable or impractical.

Entitlements will not accumulate from year to year.

Application for Personal and Family LeaveWhere practical, an employee wishing to take Personal and Family Leave will notify their manager before taking leave, stating the reason for seeking leave.

Entitlements will not accumulate from year to year.

Application for Well-being LeaveAn employee wishing to take Well-being Leave must apply to their manager in advance and it must be taken in whole days to the extent possible.

Employees with an entitlement to part of a day will be encouraged to combine it with other leave to make a full day.

In addition, one day of study leave per exam, plus leave on the day of the exam, if it falls on an employee's work day, may be taken.

Additional time without loss of pay may be granted at the discretion of VCOSS.

Part time employees are entitled to study leave on a pro rata basis.

10.10 Leave Without PayLeave without pay shall be granted by agreement for the purpose of:?

Professional development; or?

Extended study relevant to work (e.g.

Masters, PhD); or?

Secondment to a position; or?

Personal reasons (e.g.

parenting or caring responsibilities, travel).

Application for leave without pay is to be made in writing by an employee to the relevant manager.

Application for leave without pay is only open to employees who have been employed by VCOSS for at least twelve (12) months.

The application will need to outline the period of time and the purpose of the leave.

The CEO will be responsible for the final decision.

For the purposes of calculating "length of service", any periods of leave without pay are not included, in accordance with the governing legislation.

Accordingly, taking leave without pay will reduce an employee's entitlements to various forms of paid leave.

For further information refer to the Extended Absence Policy, as amended or varied by VCOSS from time to time.

10.11 Parental LeaveLeave reservedLeave is reserved to discuss and introduce further agreed changes to this clause, subsequent to the release of Federal legislation covering the government-funded Paid Parental Leave Scheme.

Eligibility for Paid Parental LeaveAn employee who has completed at least twelve (12) months' service is entitled to parental leave, to care for a newborn, adopted or permanent placement fostered child, in accordance with the SACS Award.

An employee eligible under this clause is entitled to a period of paid parental leave.

Maternity LeavePaid Maternity Leave is available for a total of thirteen (13) weeks granted with full salary.

Employees may elect to take Paid Maternity Leave over a longer period as agreed with VCOSS, eg employees may take twenty-six (26) weeks of leave paid at 50% of full salary.

Any remaining period of Maternity Leave will be taken as unpaid leave of absence.

VCOSS will allow employees, to the extent possible, to maximise their entitlement to benefits under any applicable government-funded maternity leave scheme.

If during the period of paid Maternity Leave, a pregnancy results in a stillbirth, the employee is entitled to complete the period of paid Maternity Leave at full pay.

If during the period of paid Co-Parental leave, a pregnancy results in a stillbirth, the employee is entitled to complete the period of paid Co-Parental Leave at full pay.

Unpaid Parental LeaveIn addition to Paid Parental Leave, the parent who is the primary care giver is entitled to unpaid leave of absence to extend the total period of leave up to twelve (12) months.

During the unpaid period of parental leave, further entitlements to sick leave, recreation leave and paid public holidays do not accrue and cannot, therefore, be used to extend the period of paid leave.

Commencement and Completion of Parental LeaveAn employee will, at least ten (10) weeks prior to the presumed date of birth, give notice in writing to VCOSS stating the presumed date of birth.

VCOSS recognises that commencement of Maternity Leave may not follow original intent and will be flexible and accommodating with changing circumstances provided that employees notify VCOSS of changes as soon as practical.

Variation of Period of LeaveBy giving at least fourteen (14) days of notice in writing, an employee may shorten or lengthen the period of leave to be taken; provided this is done only once within the total period of leave (except by agreement with VCOSS).

Illness Before Commencement of Maternity LeaveWhere an employee not then on maternity leave suffers illness related to her pregnancy, she may take sick leave to which she is then entitled and such further special maternity leave as a registered medical practitioner certifies as necessary before her return to work.

Special Parental LeaveMaternity LeaveWhere the pregnancy of an employee not then on paid maternity leave terminates after twenty weeks (20) other than by the birth of a living child, then the employee is entitled to take up to four weeks of paid Special Maternity Leave to assist with recovery.

In addition, she may use accrued sick leave entitlements or a period of unpaid leave, as a registered medical practitioner certifies as necessary.

Co-Parental LeaveWhere the pregnancy of a partner terminates after twenty (20) weeks other than by the birth of a living child, then the employee is entitled to take up to one week of paid Special Co-Parental Leave.

Returning to WorkWhen an employee returns to work after a period of parental leave, VCOSS must provide the employee with similar duties at the same classification level to those performed immediately before the employee commenced parental leave.

A full time employee who is the primary care giver, will be entitled to negotiate a return to part time work following parental leave, subject to operational requirements.

Termination of EmploymentAn employee may terminate his or her employment at any time during the period of leave by giving notice in accordance with this agreement.

Replacement EmployeesA replacement employee is an employee specifically engaged or temporarily promoted or transferred to fill a vacancy arising due to Parental Leave.

Before VCOSS employs a replacement employee or transfers an existing employee under this sub-clause, VCOSS will inform him or her of the temporary nature of the employment or transfer and of the rights of the employee who is being replaced.

10.12 Public HolidaysEmployees are entitled to receive full pay for a public holiday that occurs on a regular working day for that employee, as per the SACS Award.

VCOSS and an employee may agree to substitute another day for any of the public holidays prescribed in the Social and Community Services - Victoria - Award 2000.

An agreement pursuant to the above shall be recorded in writing and be available to all affected employees and the ASU.

In addition, employees will be entitled to days off with full pay on the days falling between Boxing Day and New Years Day and any additional days at the discretion of the CEO, known as 'Grace & Favour' leave.

The VCOSS office will remain closed during this period.

10.13 Jury ServiceA full time, part time or fixed term employee required to attend for jury service during their ordinary working hours shall be reimbursed by VCOSS an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid in respect of their attendance for such jury service and the amount of wages they would have received in respect of the ordinary time they would have worked had they not been on jury service.

An employee shall notify VCOSS as soon as possible of the date upon which they are required to attend for jury service.

Further the employee shall give their employer documentary proof of their attendance, the duration of such attendance and the amount received in respect of such jury service.

The classifications cover the five levels of work as performed by employees.

The purpose of the classification descriptions is to classify positions, rather than describe the work in detail.

The descriptions for each level are intended to cover a range of positions and are therefore generic in nature.

Elements that are specific to the position are contained in the position description including classification level.

Position descriptions shall be used as the primary source of classifying positions.

The position description shall be compared to the classification description to determine which level best describes and fits the position description.

VCOSS may appoint an employee on a pay point other than the entry point based on an employee's previous relevant experience and skills.

At each level employees perform work above and beyond that of the level below and to the level of their training/experience/capabilities.

Whilst employees will perform work above the level of their classification from time to time, the majority of the work performed should be at the level of their classification.

Progression from one level to a higher level is only accessible through promotion, reclassification or a successful application for a new position at a higher grade.

Any dispute about classification and salary levels or pay points will be dealt with under clause 16 Dispute Resolution.

The incremental increase is payable on the twelve month anniversary of the employee's commencement, promotion or last salary advancement at the employee's current salary and classification level.

An employee is not eligible for annual incremental progression if the employee is at the maximum point of his/her salary and classification range.

An annual incremental review will be undertaken by VCOSS for all full-time and part-time employees in order to assess the employee's progression within the classification level.

In cases where the review is delayed, the anniversary date of the twelve month review shall not be changed and the increase if any will be paid retrospectively to the anniversary date.

The annual incremental progression from one incremental point to the next within each classification level shall be automatic unless formal disciplinary or performance appraisal processes have been commenced.

If such processes have been commenced then an outcome of the process may be the non-award of an increment for a period of up to twelve months.

At the end of a probation period, as part of a probationary review, an application for accelerated incremental progression within the level can be made by an employee or recommended by their Manager.

Approval for an accelerated incremental progression can only be given by the CEO or their delegate and is limited to approval of two incremental pay points (eg movement from pay point 1 to pay point 3) within a classification level.

An employee applies for and is promoted to a position that is placed on a higher level within the salary structure, in accordance with clause 7 Recruitment of this agreement, or?

A position description or role alters significantly enough that it fits the descriptors of a higher level.

An employee may make a written application for reclassification of his or her position where there has been either: ?

Significant and identifiable changes in the nature of work and duties performed; or?

Significant changes in the skills, knowledge and experience required when undertaking the duties; or?

Significant increases in accountability and judgement;Should an employee be successful in his or her position being reclassified the date of effect shall be the date of lodgement of the application.

The 'higher duties' salary must be at least equivalent to the base salary level for the position.

The HESTA fund is the preferred fund for occupational superannuation, however employees may, subject to statutory requirements, request payments to be directed to any other fund or funds, and such a request shall not be unreasonably refused.

Expenses may include but are not limited to:?

Travel;?

Stationery;?

Parking;?

Staff amenities.

Where petty cash requirements are likely to exceed $20, prior approval from the relevant manager must be sought.

Petty cash should only be used for purposes where an expense cannot be charged to a company account.

Information on company accounts can be obtained from finance.

Employees are also entitled to a meal allowance for meals not provided, when work involves an overnight stay.

Meal allowances will be paid in accordance with the appropriate ruling provided by the Australian Taxation Office from time to time.

The current rates are set out in APPENDIX 3: MEAL ALLOWANCE RATES.

Accommodation will be paid for by VCOSS.

On approving an overnight stay, the relevant manager will take into consideration:?

The length of the overall working day, including travel time to the destination;?

The likelihood of the employee returning home by 7pm;?

The mode of transport for travel to and from the destination;?

Ensuring the health, wellbeing and safety of the employee is not compromised by the extended travel home, particularly in instances where travel to the destination is by car.

The current rates are set out in APPENDIX 3: MEAL ALLOWANCE RATES.

Meal allowance is not payable if meals are provided free of charge (e.g.

as part of a Conference).

Cab charge vouchers are available as the preferred option of payment, full reimbursement for taxi costs will be made on production of receipts.

The use of taxis will be limited to:?

Attending or facilitating workshops, training, lectures as part of work;?

Travelling home after 7.30pm;?

Attending work related meetings where travel by public transport is not convenient;?

To transport equipment for work purposes.

Employees are not expected to carry heavy boxes or equipment on public transport to either get to a venue or to reach a venue from home.

Private VehiclesPrivate vehicle mileage will be recorded from leaving VCOSS to the required destination, and will be reimbursed in accordance with the appropriate rates issued by the Australian Taxation Office from time to time.

To qualify for such reimbursement, travel must be in accordance with the employee's role as listed in their position description.

Private vehicles must carry a compulsory Third Party and Property insurance and the driver must be appropriately licensed.

VCOSS is not responsible for damage incurred (or insurance excess) to an employee's car in the course of their duties.

VCOSS therefore encourages the employee to acquire Comprehensive Insurance for their car if used for work purposes.

Employees are responsible for payment of any fines for speeding, parking or other traffic offences.

Hire CarsFor any journey over 200km, employees are required to use hire cars in preference to personal vehicles, as this is the most cost effective option.

Specific permission for use of private vehicles for trips over 200kms is required from the relevant manager.

When using hire cars, VCOSS will cover the cost of additional insurance on the car to limit personal liability to the minimum.

It is important for employees to ensure they are covered for the minimum excess, and for all damage to the vehicle including broken windscreens and damage to tyres, headlights etc.

VCOSS is not liable for any damage to the vehicle.

Interstate TravelEmployees will use economy air travel when travelling interstate.

Bookings are to be coordinated through the relevant manager with all interstate travel to be endorsed by the CEO prior to booking.

Accommodation costs must be authorised by the relevant manager.

There is a requirement to contain costs within reason.

Employees will be entitled to their own room when required to stay away overnight.

13 Training and DevelopmentVCOSS recognises that in order to increase efficiency and productivity and to enhance work satisfaction and career development, a commitment to training and skill development is necessary.

Accordingly, the organisation commits to provide employees with access to mutually agreed training opportunities, and paid leave will be granted to employees for the purpose of pursuing training opportunities.

An amount at least equal to 1.5% of the total salary budget will be available for this purpose and spent according to organisational planning arrangements.

Refer to the Training and Professional Development Policy for further information.

Employee representatives include staff representatives on committees referred to in this agreement, such as the Joint Consultative Committee, Occupational Health and Safety Committee or other committees or bodies as deemed operationally appropriate.

The Management Team will determine what constitutes 'reasonable time', if required, on a case-by-case basis.

Time allowances are not adjusted pro rata for part-time employees in employee representative roles.

Training leave entitlements are not adjusted pro rata for part-time employees in employee representative roles.

15 Occupational Health and SafetyVCOSS is responsible for providing a working environment where it is safe to work, where employees are free from harassment, and where employees are assured of appropriate workplace support in the event of a workplace incident.

VCOSS will:?

Establish and maintain an OHS management system that facilitates a structured approach to the management of OHS risk.

For this purpose, it has established an Occupational Health and Safety Committee (the OHS Committee) which in turn encourages the election of employee health and safety representatives who are consulted and involved in any workplace changes which could affect health and safety.

The OHS Committee will consist of (at least) the elected health and safety representative/s and a VCOSS management representative, with a minimum of half the committee consisting of non-management employees.

The OHS Committee will meet at least once every 3 months and will operate in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004.

during induction, including fire safety and evacuation?

on an ongoing basis, such as fire drills, and?

as issues arise, including when implementing and reviewing OHS systems.

Occupational Health and Safety Representatives?

First Aid Officers?

All employees are required to report any incident and injury to their manager in the first instance and record the incident, in detail, in the 'OHS Incidents and Near Misses Report'.

This report should include name of staff member, type of incident, nature of injury if applicable, date, time, place where incident occurred, and the name of the relevant manager notified.

The responsibility is then with the relevant manager to report the injury to the Occupational Health and Safety representative/s and Human Resources staff who will ensure an investigation is carried out and appropriate action taken.

This may include ensuring that the staff member has been seen by a health practitioner and ongoing support and assessment is in place.

VCOSS agrees to provide relevant rehabilitation to employees who have suffered an injury or illness that is work-related.

VCOSS shall investigate the possibility of providing alternative duties to assist in the rehabilitation process in consultation with the rehabilitation provider.

VCOSS believes that all people have the right to work in an environment that is free of harassment and bullying.

VCOSS is committed to preventing all forms of harassment and bullying and redressing an issue where it has occurred.

The relevant manager is required to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and equitably and are not subject to harassment and bullying.

VCOSS will also ensure that complainants and witnesses are not victimised in any way.

Any reports of harassment or bullying will be treated seriously by VCOSS, and will be investigated thoroughly and confidentially.

Disciplinary action will be taken against anyone found to be guilty of harassing or bullying employees, volunteers or visitors.

16 Dispute ResolutionAn employee who has a grievance arising out of his/her employment shall have the right for the grievance to be heard through each level of management.

VCOSS will make every effort to attempt to assist the employees resolving the conflict, without prejudice.

It is not to be used as a disciplinary procedure - the correct process for a disciplinary procedure is outlined elsewhere in this agreement and when necessary will be adhered to.

It is expected that all parties involved in the process will attempt to keep the details of any conflict and the steps to resolve it confidential, however staff may seek support through JCC staff representatives, as required.

1.

In the first instance, the employee shall attempt to resolve the grievance with the other party concerned.

The employee will, in the first instance, approach the staff member they have an issue with and raise the matter directly with them.

This step may take the form of one informal meeting, or it may be a series of meetings as agreed by both parties.

2.

In situations where it is clear that the employees are unable to rectify the situation without the input of a third party, staff may seek support from their relevant manager.

In the case where the complaint is with the CEO, the staff member may seek support of the President of the Board.

At this stage the relevant manager will assist in developing agreed strategies for staff members to work on with an ongoing support or review process.

Either party may be represented by an employee or employer representatives and/or the Joint Consultative Committee.

3.

If the employee still feels aggrieved, he/she shall inform the CEO, or President of the Board if appropriate,  who shall consult with the parties.

An employee representative or JCC may be present at the request of either party.

4.

If after all reasonable steps have been taken in an endeavour to resolve the grievance, as detailed above, and the grievance remains unresolved, then the employee representative shall be advised in writing and a meeting arranged with employer representative and the employee representative.

5.

If the grievance still exists the matter may be referred to an appropriate body, e.g.

Australian Industrial Relations Commission or another mutually acceptable person or body for mediation, conciliation or arbitration.

The result of this process shall be accepted as final by both parties.

6.

Steps 1 to 4 shall take place within ten (10) working days.

7.

Employees may seek mediation from steps 2 to 4 if mutually agreed upon.

8.

At any point during this procedure an employee shall have the right to seek advice and support from their representative and/or VCOSS JCC.

9.

Until the grievance is determined, work shall continue normally in accordance with the custom and practice existing before the grievance while discussions take place, as long as this is mutually agreed upon by the parties involved.

Health and safety matters are exempted from this clause.

10.

No party shall be prejudiced as to the final settlement by the continuation of work.

11.

All employees shall be handed a copy of these procedures on commencement of employment.

The disciplinary procedure shall be fair and negotiable.

Discussion between management and staff is encouraged.

It is important to note that employees have the right to look at their personnel files and to make copies of documents held therein.

Procedure of Disciplinary ActionFirst Warning1.

The employee in question is told by their manager as soon as possible of any complaint concerning the performance of their work.

2.

Complaints must be specific in nature, citing specific examples, including times and dates relating to the complaint.

not "s/he doesn't get along with the team" - this is a grievance).

3.

The complaint is to be discussed with the employee and the relevant manager (as the employer representative), who will mutually determine a strategy to improve/eliminate the behaviour in question.

The staff member is entitled to have an employee representative or another 'support' person present at the discussion.

4.

The warning is recorded on file.

5.

The employee shall be given the opportunity to sign the entry and be given a copy of the entry.

If the employee declined to sign the entry, the record will be endorsed to that effect by management and the employee may add comments.

Second Warning1.

If the problem continues or occurs again after the verbal warning, the employee may be given written notice of the complaint/s against them.

Again the complaints must cite further specific examples, including times and dates.

2.

The matter is then reported to the CEO.

At all times confidentiality should be maintained to minimise loss of confidence and respect.

A representative of VCOSS management will then meet with the staff member.

The staff member then has the opportunity to discuss the complaints made against them.

The staff member is entitled to be represented by an employee representative of their choice.

3.

A trial period is set during which certain changes should occur.

A date is then set to review the agreed changes.

4.

A review takes place after this trial period.

A written record of this meeting should be placed on the staff member's file.

5.

After this the dispute may be resolved and there may be no need for further action.

6.

The employee shall be given the opportunity to sign the entry and be given a copy of the entry.

If the employee declines to sign the entry, the record will be endorsed to that effect by management.

Final Written Warning1.

If the problem persists, another meeting is called by the CEO and the employee is given notice to attend.

2.

The employee has the right of reply to discuss the situation.

They are also entitled to have an employee representative of their choice attend the meeting.

3.

The matter is discussed and further action may be considered.

Both parties need to negotiate what this action might be and the employee is given written notice (a final written warning).

Again an accurate record of this meeting should be placed on file.

4.

The employee shall be given the opportunity to sign the entry and be given a copy of this entry.

If the employee declines to sign the entry, the record will be endorsed to that effect by management.

5.

If this meeting resolves the dispute there is no need for further action.

Whilst at any stage, either party may refer the matter to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, VCOSS strongly recommends that both parties make reasonable attempts to resolve the issue/s using the above process.

Management may also consider alternatives like a formal "dispute resolution meeting" to further attempt to resolve the problem before deciding on termination.

Developing and maintaining constructive on-going interaction between VCOSS, employees and the employee industrial representative organisation party to this agreement.

?

Agreed objectives for the organisation.

?

Right of EntryA properly accredited official or officer of the Australian Services Union or other relevant Union shall have rights of access to enter VCOSS for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the award and for disagreements or other matters relating to the relationship between VCOSS and its employees.

Workplace Representative TrainingEach employee nominated as an employee representative shall be entitled to devote reasonable time to attend to staff representation issues on the job, in addition to any committee involvement.

All workplace representatives shall be entitled to paid training leave.

The costs of this will be attributed to the core of the organisation, not any particular service or business unit.

Part timers shall get full entitlements.

The employee may negotiate with their manager to alter the notice period after the resignation has been submitted.

An employee will not be dismissed without regard to the Disciplinary Procedure as outlined in clause 16.2.

Instant DismissalVCOSS is committed to constructive relationships with employees, however, should circumstances constituting serious misconduct arise, instant dismissal may be the most appropriate course of action.

Serious misconduct includes the following:?

Wilful misconduct, that is serious in nature and that compromises the organisation;?

Dishonesty of the employee in relation to the employment;?

Commission of a crime in the course of employment;?

Commission of a crime outside the course of employment which is relevant to the duties of the employee and compromises the organisation;?

Neglect of duty which happens on a regular basis and is of serious nature; and?

Abandonment of employment.

An employee that is instantly dismissed shall not be entitled to payment in lieu of notice.

Redundancy occurs where VCOSS has made a definite decision that it no longer wishes the job the employee has been doing done by anyone and that decision leads to the termination of employment of the employee.

A demonstrated intention by VCOSS to seek funding to continue the employment of such an employee is evidence that VCOSS considers their employment to be dependent upon recurrent Government or other funding.

In such a case, the relevant manager has a responsibility to inform staff members that the position is redundant and to investigate avenues to redeploy.

If redeployment is not possible, the Award provisions will apply (Termination of employment and Redundancy).

Job VacanciesAny employee made redundant will not be considered an Internal Employee as defined in clause 6.11.

Severance PayIn addition to the period of notice required for termination, as outlined below, and any leave entitlements owing (including any accrued annual leave, time in lieu and pro rata long service leave), employees who have completed at least 26 weeks continuous employment and who are made redundant are entitled to severance pay in accordance with the table below.

Period of continuous serviceSeverance pay26 to 52 weeks2 weeksMore than 52 weeks and up to 2 years4 weeksMore than 2 years and up to 3 years6 weeksMore than 3 years and up to 4 years7 weeksMore than 4 years and up to 5 years8 weeksMore than 5 years and up to 6 years10 weeksMore than 6 years and up to 7 years11weeksMore than 7 years and up to 8 years13 weeksMore than 8 years and up to 9 years14 weeksMore than 9 years16 weeksA week of severance pay means the ordinary pay for the employee concerned.

Time Off During Notice PeriodDuring the period of notice of termination given by VCOSS, an employee shall be entitled to one day's time off without loss of pay during each week of notice for the purposes of seeking other employment.

10 - UNIVERSITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT

10.1	This Agreement focuses on principles relating to staff conditions of employment and entitlements.

The parties to this Agreement have sought to simplify the construction of this Agreement while ensuring that staff do not lose entitlements.

The Agreement aims to be simple and easily understood and to provide sufficient flexibility for the University and its staff to apply these principles as required by local operating conditions across its diverse operations.

More extensive detail about the scope and operations of the matters referred to is found in the Handbook of University Policies and Procedures (HUPP).

10.2	While not forming part of this Agreement, Schedule 1A policies in force at the date of lodgement of the Agreement are designed to give effect and detailed support for the matters covered in the Enterprise Agreement (Academic Staff) 2006 and are those approved by the University Senate on 28 July 2006 or the dates as shown in Schedule 1A.

10.3	The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that it is established custom and practice within the University that consultation on academic staff matters take place with the academic staff, including through the ASCC.

It is agreed that issues relevant to the employment of academic staff will be codified as follows:

10.3.1	The policies set out in Schedules 1A and 1B of this Agreement shall be read in conjunction with this Agreement but do not form part of the Agreement.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be taken as incorporating as a term of this Agreement, any policy, procedures or guideline referred to in this Agreement.

10.3.2.

The University will make a specific decision, taking into account the views of the ASCC and affected staff, as to whether any new policies established after lodgement of this Agreement should be added to those listed in Schedules 1A and 1B.

10.4	No additions, deletions or any other changes (that have the effect of altering employment conditions) will be made to the policies as agreed without reasonable notice and prior consultation with the ASCC and affected staff.

B - SALARIES AND RELATED MATTERS

12.5.1	An academic staff member will be eligible for movement, at least no later than twelve months since appointment or the previous increment, to the next highest salary point within the academic level as set out in Schedule III - Salary rates.

This will follow an assessment of at least "satisfactory" in a performance review carried out in accordance with clause 17.

12.5.2	Movement to the next highest salary point will be effective from the date provided in 12.5.1.

In cases where a performance review is delayed, the date will not be changed and any increase in salary will be paid retrospectively in accordance with 12.5.1.

12.5.3	An academic staff member who has been absent in excess of three months, in aggregate, will have the review delayed by the period of absence.

Any resultant increase will also be delayed by the period of absence.

* the nature of the improvement required;
* the time within which such improvement should occur;
* the date of a formal performance review to consider whether the improvements have been made.

23.4	An appropriate duration, not less than one semester nor more than two semesters, will be provided for the academic to demonstrate the required improvement.

The supervisor will make all reasonable effort to provide resources to the academic to assist him/her to achieve the required improvements.

This may involve more than one consultation where the staff member's condition/s requires it.

This does not apply in circumstances where the staff member is on sick leave but has not reached the expiry of the 3 months qualifying period or such period of paid sick leave as the fund requires.

The relevant senior executive may only direct a staff member to attend a medical examination/s in these circumstances where the capacity of the staff member to perform their duties remains in doubt.

* assist co-operatively in changing programs and courses through the available forums to ensure, for example, that unnecessary duplication or non-viable  programs and/or courses are avoided.

The maximum hours specified in the guidelines will not be varied within the nominal life of the Agreement.

To ensure the effective planning for, and management of, organisational change which does not involve redundancies, the relevant manager/s will ensure that:
* consultation is carried out with all staff, and if they so choose with their representatives, who will be affected by the organisational change; and 
* existing consultation mechanisms including the ASCC and others such as School standing committees or ad hoc mechanisms such as representative working parties are utilised; and 
* necessary information including budgetary information, is provided to all affected staff.

28.1.2	Where organisational change involves the possibility that staff will be excess to requirements, and the possibility that retrenchments might result, the restructuring process described below will be followed.

28.4.2	The Proposal will be circulated to all affected staff.

Normally there will be a period of 10 working days for consideration by affected staff.

28.5.

Where the Proposal involves an organisational unit to which one of the standing committee members belongs, or where there is a casual vacancy, a replacement Executive Dean or Head of School will be nominated by the relevant senior executive, and a replacement academic staff member will be nominated by the elected staff representative members of the ASCC.

28.5.4	The University Standing Committee for Change Management will meet as frequently as is necessary with a view to completing its deliberations within 20 working days, or other such time as determined by the committee.

28.5.5	The role of the Committee will be to consider and provide meaningful advice as to whether the proposed restructuring is justified and reasonable.

The committee will make a recommendation to either accept the Proposal, or reject the Proposal or call for modifications.

i) If the relevant manager revises the Proposal and re-submits it, it will be considered by the Committee, which will recommend either the acceptance or rejection of the revised proposal.

ii) If the relevant manager provides a justification why the modifications cannot be implemented, the Committee will re-consider the original Proposal.

In the first instance he/she will pursue voluntary mechanisms by offering to staff in the affected area the opportunity to express interest in Voluntary Separation Packages (VSP) and/or to seek fractional appointments.

Staff who wish to pursue both options should indicate whether their first preference is a VSP or a fractional appointment.

Staff will have 5 working days to respond.

The manager should communicate the decision to the staff member within 10 working days of receiving the request.

Staff who are not able to be accommodated as a fractional appointee, will be eligible to express an interest in a VSP, provided they have nominated this preference in response to the manager's notification.

Voluntary Separation Packages will be as at Clause 28.10 and decided in accordance with policy.

The redeployee will not be required to compete against external or internal applicants in open competition.

Alternatively the staff member may notify Human Resources Division of positions for which they wish to be considered.

This arrangement will only apply where superannuation fund rules allow.

The staff member and the Executive Dean/Deputy Vice-Chancellor will have the opportunity to make verbal or written submissions to the Panel.

That decision will be communicated to the staff member and to the Executive Dean/Deputy Vice-Chancellor within 10 working days of the receipt of the application for review.

OR

(b)	Payment in lieu of notice as specified in the staff member's contract of employment.

(Less PAYE tax).

Step 2:	Calculate the amount of money after tax as cash in hand that the staff member would receive as follows:

* severance pay at the rate of 2 weeks' pay for each year of service taxed concessionally, up to a maximum of 52 weeks;
* normal salary for six months' further employment, less PAYE   tax;
* payment on pro-rate basis for any long service leave, taxed at the appropriate rate.

Step 3:	The individual staff member chooses which of the amounts calculated by Step 1 and Step 2 he/she wishes to receive.

Step 4:	The University adds to the amount identified in Step 3, the concessional tax for which the member is liable and this new sum becomes the severance amount.

Where there has been a combination of full time and fractional service then fractional service will be converted into full time equivalent service and payment made at the full time salary rate.

29 - VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT

The University may offer early retirement in accordance with a scheme approved by the Commissioner of Taxation provided that any lump sum benefit shall be calculated at a minimum rate of two weeks salary for each year of service, but with no obligation upon the institution to pay beyond a maximum of 52 weeks salary.

Detailed provisions for the granting and taking of leave and all leave related entitlements by various categories of staff and the arrangements for payment while on leave will be in accordance with the relevant leave policies referenced in the leave table below.

SCHEDULE 1A - LIST OF RELEVANT POLICIES CONFIRMED BY SENATE
Preamble:
The policies in this list have been identified pursuant to the publication of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements (HEWRRs) by the Federal Government on 29 April, 2005.

The HEWRRs require that workplace agreements must be "simple, flexible and principle-based documents".

To comply with this requirement, details have been removed from the Enterprise Agreement certified on 10 May 2005 and placed in the following policies to ensure that matters negotiated in the most recent round continue to have effect, while compliance with the HEWRRs is maintained.

Additionally some matters contained in The Higher Education Academic Salaries Award 2002 and the Universities and Post Compulsory Academic Conditions Award 1999 have been incorporated into some of the policies listed below to clarify that they remain current conditions of employment for academic staff.

Not every policy referred to in the body of the Enterprise Agreement is listed in this Schedule 1A.

Some policies which are noted in the Agreement remain in Schedule 1B because they do not contain details or procedures removed from the original documents.

The Contractor is not in partnership, or in a joint venture or an employee, servant or agent of the Principal.

Nothing in this agreement is construed as to constitute the Principal to be an employer and the Contractor (or its own employees and agents) to be an employee.

It is the express intention of the parties that such a relationship is denied.

Nothing in this agreement is construed as to constitute either party to be the agent of the other.

It
is the express intention of the parties that such a relationship is denied.

i.

Is able to delegate duties for the contracted services.

ii.

Is required to make its own insurance and tax payment arrangements.

iii.

Controls and is responsible for itself and its employees.

Further, the Contractor states that it has the necessary insurances (such as Workers Compensation and Public Liability) for itself and any of its employees and sub-contractors connected with the Principal's business.

The Contractor provides evidence of such insurance prior to the commencement of this Agreement.

The Contractor shall supply evidence of cover of Workers Compensation and Public Liability.

Further the Contractor indemnifies the Principal and pays any additional payroll tax payable because of grouping.

The Contractor does not use (or attempt to use) any Confidential Information in any manner.

The Contractor does not use (or attempt to use) any Confidential Information that may (directly or indirectly) cause injury to the Principal (or the Principal's business) or which may be likely to do so.

This restriction continues after the Work is completed.

This restriction continues after this agreement terminates.

The Principal and its agents agree to keep confidential the Contractors Confidential Information ("Contractors Confidential Information") being all information relating to the current or future business interests, methodology or affairs of the Contractor and its related parties or any person or entity with which it deals or is concerned with, including, without limitation, all:

i.   technical data;
ii.

research and development information;
iii.

business records, compliance processes and procedures, training processes and procedures, copyright   documents, electronic communications or records and software supplied under the agreement, client records, information, notes, products, know how, trade secrets, or other data;
iv.

accounting procedures or financial information;
v.  names and details of clients, suppliers and agents;
vi.

employee details; and
vii.

secret information; reasonably regarded as confidential, being information not in the public domain to the  Contractor's competitors.

6.

When are documents and records returned to the Principal?

All records and documents (paper, electronic or otherwise) and copies and extracts made or acquired by the Contractor, in the course of performing the Work, are the Principal's property.

The Contractor collects up and returns such records and documents to the Principal when the agreement is terminated or upon the Principal's demand.

7.

How does the Contractor protect the Principal?

The Contractor:
i.

Acts, with the utmost good faith in all of its dealings with the Principal.

ii.

Does not intentionally do anything which is or may be harmful to the Principal.

iii.

Reports promptly all reasonable information, explanations and advice which the Principal requires or as to  which the Principal should properly be informed of.

The Contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the Principal against liability for all loss, damage or injury to persons or property caused by the Contractor.

The amount of such claims, damages, costs and expenses payable, suffered or incurred by the Principal for any such loss, damage or injury is made good at the Contractor's expense.

Such loss, damage or injury is deducted from the value of Remuneration due or becoming due to the Contractor.

The Contractor's primary duty is to carry out the business the Contractor has undertaken, or to inform the Principal promptly if it is impossible to do so.

Any instruction as to the manner in which the business is to be carried out must be complied with strictly.

The Contractor has no discretion to disregard such instructions, even though the Contractor acts in good faith and in the interest of the Principal.

Where no definite instructions have been given, or where the Contractor's authority allows discretion, the Contractor must be guided by the honest exercise of judgement and the interests of the Principal.

A professional Contractor must follow the ordinary course of its business, which includes the ordinary course of any previous business between the Principal and the Contractor.

The Contractor shall use any information obtained by reason of the contract solely for the purpose of this agreement.

A Contractor is under a duty to employ any materials and information of or for the Principal by reason of the agreement solely for the purpose of the agreement, and not in any manner inconsistent with good faith.

The Contractor may not divulge them to third parties, or use them in unfair competition with the Principal.

A Contractor who acts in breach of duty is liable to make an account of profits and to render equitable compensation.

A Contractor should not act for a second principal in a manner which may result in a conflict of duties.

A Contractor is permitted to place a conflict of duty behind personal interests if, and only if, the Contractor has first made to the principal full written disclosure of the exact nature of the interests.

And further the Principal has so assented in writing.

It is insufficient merely to disclose that the Contractor has an interest.

A Contractor should only purport to bind the Principal when the Contractor is duly authorised to do so.

Unless the terms of the Contractor's appointment permit, the Contractor must contract with third parties in the principal's name and not in the Contractor's own name (unless the contractor is a factor, who has implied authority to contract with third parties in his or her own name).

The Contractor is responsible to the Principal for losses occasioned by want of proper care, skill or diligence in the carrying out of its duties.

This is even where the principal may have been negligent in not discovering the Contractor's breach of duty.

A Contractor for reward is bound to exercise a higher standard of care, skill, or diligence than a gratuitous contractor, and the standard required in such cases is not merely that which the Contractor in fact possesses, but that which is reasonably necessary for the due performance of the Contractor's undertaking.

A Contractor keeps accurate accounts of all transactions and be prepared at all times to produce them to the Principal.

All documents and books relating to the Principal's business must be produced to the Principal (or the Principal's nominee) on demand.

The terms of a Contractor's appointment will determine whether money entrusted to or received by the Contractor on the Principal's behalf must be kept separate or may be mixed with the Contractor's own money.

In the former case, the Contractor will be a trustee; in the latter, a debtor.

In the case of debtor an appropriate interest rate is agreed, from time to time, between the parties.

A Contractor employed to carry out any transaction which involves receiving a payment on the Principal's behalf must not compromise the rights of the Principal, or part with the Principal's property, until payment is received.

This is unless otherwise authorised.

In the absence of instructions or of contrary usage, payment is received in cash or bank cheque.

All moneys received on the Principal's behalf is paid over or accounted for upon request, unless the Contractor has for some lawful reason repaid them to the person from whom the Contractor received them.

It is immaterial if the relevant transaction was void or illegal, provided the contract itself is not illegal.

A 
Contractor cannot retain moneys against the Principal for a debt due to the Contractor from the person paying them, or because of some claim to the moneys by a third person.

Each Schedule, incorporating the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and all of the other documents and agreements executed in connection herewith (the "Lease Documents") constitutes a separate lease (a "Lease"), or if the Schedule refers only to finance items, then a financing transaction ("Financing Transaction") and shall be effective when signed by both the Lessor and the Lessee.

1.2	Equipment Procurement and Title.

Lessee has selected or will select Equipment to be procured from Cisco Systems, Inc. or another manufacturer, reseller or vendor acceptable to Lessor (together, "Vendor").

Lessee will notify Lessor in writing of its procurement or intent to procure such Equipment and its request to enter into a Lease in respect of such Equipment.

Lessee shall be deemed to have assigned to Lessor, effective upon Lessor signing the Schedule, all Lessee's right to purchase the Equipment including any purchase order or contract relating thereto; provided that Lessor shall have no obligation under such purchase order or contract other than the obligation to pay the Vendor the purchase price of such Equipment.

If for whatever reason the lease transaction in respect of any Equipment is not consummated, Lessee shall be solely liable to pay Vendor in accordance with the applicable purchase order or contract and shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from any liability or payment incurred or made in connection therewith.

Except as expressly set forth in any Lease, and subject to the rights of any assignee of Lessor, Lessor shall at all times retain title to the Equipment.

1.3	Term Not Cancellable and Obligations Absolute.

ONCE THE TERM OF ANY LEASE OR ANY FINANCING TRANSACTION HAS BEGUN, LESSEE'S OBLIGATION TO PAY RENT AND ALL OTHER AMOUNTS DUE UNDER A LEASE OR FINANCING TRANSACTION IS ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL, AND SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED BY ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY RIGHT OF SETOFF, DEFENSE, COUNTERCLAIM, INTERRUPTION, DEFERMENT OR RECOUPMENT OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLAIMS OF LESSEE AGAINST LESSOR OR AGAINST ANY MANUFACTURER OR SUPPLIER OF THE EQUIPMENT, OR ANYONE ELSE, FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER.

Lessee must not withhold any payment under this Lease, or make a deduction from it for any reason including because the Equipment is damaged or does not operate or is not in Lessee's possession.

2	RENT; NET LEASE
	Lessee shall pay Lessor Rent as and when specified in each Schedule, without demand.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Lessor, the Rent for any extended Term shall be payable monthly, in advance.

If the Commencement Date is not the first day of the month, Lessee must pay on the first day of the month immediately following the Commencement Date, the Rent calculated on a daily basis for the period between the Commencement Date and the first day of the month immediately following the Commencement Date.

The daily rate of Rent payable in any particular month by Lessee, will be calculated by dividing the Rent payable by the number of days in that month.

Lessee shall continue to pay to Lessor Rent, notwithstanding the expiration by its terms of the Original Term or any extension thereof ("Extended Term") until the Equipment has been returned and accepted by Lessor in the condition required under Section 5.2.

The entire period of the Original Term and any Extented Term shall be refered to herein as the "Lease Term" Upon Lessee's execution thereof, each Schedule shall constitute a non-cancelable net lease, and all costs, expenses and liabilities relating to the Equipment, including with respect of taxes, insurance and maintenance, shall be borne solely by the Lessee.

Lessee's legal name is as shown in the preamble of this Agreement.

"Material Adverse Effect" shall mean a material impairment of the ability of Lessee to perform its obligations under or remain in compliance with such Lease or any of the other Lease Documents.

4	COVENANTS OF LESSEE 
4.1	Credit Review.

For each Lease and/or Financing Transaction, Lessee consents to a reasonable credit review.

Lessee shall promptly furnish to Lessor financial statements or such other financial information as Lessor may reasonably request regarding the condition and operations of Lessee and those of any guarantor of any Lease.

Lessee must notify Lessor immediately of any event which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.2	Additional Documents.

Lessee shall obtain and deliver to Lessor any documents, filings, waivers (including landlord and mortgagee waivers), releases and other records, and will take such further action as Lessor may reasonably request in furtherance of Lessor's rights under any of the Lease Documents.

Lessee shall provide Lessor at least 20 days prior written notice of any change in Lessee's name, jurisdiction or form of organization.

4.3	Prohibitions Related to Lease and Equipment.

Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lessor, Lessee may, at Lessee's sole risk and expense, relocate the Equipment within Australia.

5	USE AND MAINTENANCE
5.1	Use of Equipment.

5.2	Delivery and Installation; Maintenance and Repair; Inspection.

Lessee shall be solely responsible, at its own expense, for the delivery of the Equipment to Lessee and installation thereof.

During the Lease Term, Lessee shall keep the Equipment in good repair, condition and working order and at the expiration or termination of the Lease Term with respect to any of the Equipment, have such Equipment inspected and certified acceptable for maintenance service by the manufacturer.

Subject to reasonable advance notice and Lessee's security requirements, Lessee shall make the Equipment and its related log and maintenance records available to Lessor for inspection during business hours.

5.3	Taxes.

Lessee agrees to pay when due or reimburse Lessor for all license fees, assessments, and sales, use, property, excise and other taxes and charges (other than franchise taxes or taxes measured by Lessor's net income), now and hereafter imposed by any governmental body or agency upon or with respect to any of the Equipment, or the possession, ownership, use or operation thereof, or any Lease.

If required by law to pay property taxes, Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for property taxes within 30 days of Lessee's receipt of an invoice for such taxes.

5.4	Risk of Loss.

Lessee relieves Lessor of responsibility for all risks or physical damage to or loss or destruction of the Equipment upon due acceptance of the Equipment until the end of the Lease Term.

Lessee will promptly repair any damaged Equipment unless such Equipment is totally lost, stolen or irreparably damaged for any cause whatever (a "Loss Event").

Upon receipt by Lessor of such payment, the Rent shall cease to accrue on such item of Equipment, and Lessor shall convey to Lessee all of Lessor's right, title and interest to such Equipment, "AS IS, WHERE IS," but subject to the requirements of any third party insurance carrier in order to settle an insurance claim.

5.5	Insurance.

Each insurance policy shall name Lessee as insured and Lessor and its assignees as additional insured and the sole loss payees, and shall provide that it may not be cancelled or altered without at least 30 days' prior written notice thereof being given to Lessor (or 10 days' notice in the event of non-payment of premiums).

Lessee shall promptly provide certificates of insurance to Lessor as may be requested from time to time.

5.6	Identification.

Lessee shall place and maintain permanent markings on the Equipment evidencing Lessor's ownership, security and other interests therein, as requested by Lessor, and will keep the Equipment free of any other labeling which might be interpreted as a claim of ownership.

5.7	Alterations and Modifications.

Any addition, attachment, alteration or improvement to any item of Equipment shall belong to and become the property of Lessor unless it is removed prior to the return of such item of Equipment by Lessee.

Lessee shall be responsible for all costs relating to such removal and shall restore such item of Equipment to the condition otherwise required hereunder.

6.

INDEMNITY
	Lessee hereby indemnifies, protects, defends and holds harmless Lessor and any assignee, and their respective agents and employees (each an "Indemnitee") from and against any and all Claims (other than that which directly results from the actual gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee) by paying or otherwise discharging the same when it becomes due.

Each of the parties shall give the other prompt written notice of any Claim of which it becomes aware.

7.

8.

ACCEPTANCE OF EQUIPMENT FOR LEASE; DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES
8.1	Acceptance of Equipment for Lease.

Lessee has selected the Equipment and disclaims reliance on any statements whatsoever made by Lessor.

Upon delivery, Lessee shall inspect, and if conforming to the applicable Supply Contract, accept the Equipment and execute and deliver to Lessor a Schedule describing the Equipment.

The Schedule will evidence Lessee's unconditional and irrevocable acceptance under the Schedule of the Equipment described therein.

8.2	Warranties and Disclaimer of Warranties.

Lessor warrants to Lessee that, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lessor will not disturb Lessee's quiet and peaceful enjoyment, possession and use of the Equipment.

Lessor assigns to Lessee all manufacturer and Supplier warranty rights, to the extent Lessor holds such rights, without representation or warranty for the Lease Term, upon the execution and delivery of a Schedule with respect to the applicable Equipment.

Enforcement of any such rights shall be at Lessee's sole cost and expense.

Nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as affecting the implication of any term into this Lease which by statute (including the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW) and equivalent legislation in other jurisdictions) may not be excluded.

To the extent permitted by the relevant statute, Lessor's liability under this Agreement in respect of a breach of any such implied term is limited, at Lessor's option, to the repair or replacement of the goods or the hire of equivalent goods to Lessee, or payment to Lessee of the cost of repairing or replacing the goods or hiring equivalent goods to Lessee.

|9.

Lessee may, by notifying the Lessor in writing ninety days (90) prior to the expiration of the Original Term or any Extended Term of a Lease, return the Equipment provided Lessee is not then in default and the return conditions in this clause have been met.

Return conditions include the following.

(i ) At least ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the Lease and at the Lessor's request, cause manufacturer's representative or qualified maintenance provider acceptable to us, to perform a comprehensive physical inspection including testing all material and workmanship of the Equipment; and repair or replace any defective material to the Lessor's satisfaction.

Lessee may, upon at least thirty days (30) prior written notice to Lessor, renew the Lease provided Lessee is not then in default.

Lessor shall offer an Extended Term for ninety (90) day periods (each, an "Extended Term"), but may, if requested, offer different Extended Terms.

For Equipment with a fair market value end-of-Lease renewal option, the renewal Rent shall be the projected fair market rental value of the Equipment as of the commencement of such renewal Term.

For Equipment with a prestated end-of-Lease renewal option, the renewal Rent shall be stated in the Schedule and such renewal Rent payments will be quarterly and payable in advance.

For purposes of this Paragraph, current Rent shall be calculated as the sum of the Lease payments over the Original Term divided by the number of months in the Original Term of the Lease.

Any one-time charge (indicated on the Schedule as the "Amount Financed") for a Financed Item will be paid by Lessor to Lessee's Supplier or directly to Lessee.

Any other charges which may be owed or due to Lessee's Supplier shall be paid directly to Supplier by Lessee.

Lessee's obligation to pay Rent for the Financed Item shall not be affected by any discontinuance, return or destruction of any Financed Item on or after the date Lessor make funds available.

If Lessee rejects or discontinues any of the Financed Items in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement with Lessee's Supplier prior to the date Lessor make funds available, then the Financing Transaction with respect to the affected one-time charge shall be cancelled.

10.2.

Prepayment.

Lessee may terminate a Lease or Financing Transaction by paying all outstanding Rent, prepaying its remaining Rent and returning the Equipment to Lessor in good condition.

Lessor may, depending on market conditions at the time, reduce the remaining Rent to reflect such prepayment and shall advise Lessee of the balance to be paid.

If a Lease is terminated, Lessee shall at the same time prepay any related line items of Financing Transactions.

11.

DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
11.1	Events of Default.

11.2	Remedies.

Each right and remedy granted to Lessor under any Lease shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy existing in equity, at law, by virtue of statute or otherwise, and may be exercised by Lessor from time to time concurrently or independently and as often and in such order as Lessor may elect.

Any failure or delay on the part of Lessor in exercising any such right or remedy shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

The "Discount Rate" shall be the bank overdraft reference rate published by Rabobank Limited prior to the date of cancellation of the Lease or Financing Transaction.

An "FMV Lease" is lease which gives the Lessee an option to purchase the leased equipment at the Fair Market Value at the end of the lease term.

"Fair Market Value" means the price of the Equipment as determined by Lessor through commercially reasonable means.

12.

GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY
12.1	Extent of guarantor's obligations.

The Guarantor acknowledges that Lessor enters into this Agreement and each Lease Document in reliance on this guarantee and indemnity from the Guarantor.

12.2	Guarantee.

In consideration of Lessor agreeing to enter into this Agreement and each Lease Document with Lessee, the Guarantor guarantees that Lessee will pay Lessor all amounts payable under each Lease Document when they are due.

This guarantee continues until all these amounts have been paid in full.

If Lessor asks, the Guarantor must pay Lessor any amount which Lessee does not pay Lessor when it is due under the relevant Lease Document.

Lessor need not ask Lessee first to pay Lessor.

12.3	Indemnity.

The Guarantor indemnifies Lessor against, and the Guarantor must therefore pay Lessor for, loss or costs Lessor suffers or incurs if: Lessee does not, is not obliged to, or is unable to, pay Lessor in accordance with a Lease Document; or the Guarantor is not obliged to pay Lessor an amount under Section 12.2; or Lessor is obliged or agrees to pay an amount to a trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator in connection with a payment by the Guarantor or Lessee.

It continues after those other obligations end.

12.4	Our costs and other expenses.

The Guarantor must pay Lessor for: its reasonable costs in arranging, administering (including enforcing or taking any other action in connection with its rights) and terminating this guarantee and indemnity; and all stamp and other duties, fees, taxes and charges payable in connection with this guarantee and indemnity and any transaction (such as a payment or receipt) under it, and any interest, penalties, fines and expenses in connection with them.

12.5	Interest.

This interest is to be calculated and is payable in accordance with Section 11.2
12.6	Reinstatement of rights.

The Guarantor acknowledges that a trustee in bankruptcy, liquidator or similar person may ask Lessor to refund a payment it has received in connection with any Lease Document or this guarantee and indemnity.

To the extent Lessor is obliged to, or agrees to, make a refund, Lessor may treat the original payment as if it had not been made.

Lessor is then entitled to its rights against the Guarantor under this guarantee and indemnity as if the payment had never been made.

12.7	Lessor's rights are protected.

Rights given to Lessor under this guarantee and indemnity and the Guarantor's liabilities under it are not affected by any act or omission by Lessor or by anything else that might otherwise affect them under law relating to guarantees and indemnities including that the Guarantor may not be aware of the terms of any particular Lease Document.

This guarantee and indemnity does not merge with or adversely affect: any other guarantee or indemnity, or mortgage, charge or other security, or right or remedy to which Lessor is entitled at any time; or a judgment or order which Lessor obtains against the Guarantor in respect of an amount payable under this guarantee and indemnity in respect of any Lease Document.

Lessor can still exercise its rights under this guarantee and indemnity as well as under the judgment, order, other guarantee or security.

12.8	Guarantor's rights are suspended.

12.9	The Guarantor's acknowledgements.

The Guarantor acknowledges that the Guarantor is responsible for making itself aware of the financial position of Lessee and any other person who guarantees Lessee's obligations under this guarantee and indemnity.

The Guarantor declares that it does not enter into this Agreement or any Lease Document, as a trustee, unless the Guarantor has told Lessor otherwise in writing.

If the Guarantor is a trustee, Annexure A to this Agreement applies equally to the Guarantor.

12.10	General.

The Guarantor must pay any amount payable to Lessor under this guarantee and indemnity on the date Lessor specifies.

The Guarantor must promptly do anything Lessor asks (such as obtaining consents, signing and producing documents and getting documents completed and signed) to bind itself under this guarantee and indemnity.

Lessor may claim against the Guarantor under this guarantee and indemnity before it enforces any of its rights: 	against Lessee or any other person; or b)	under another document such as a guarantee or mortgage, charge or other security.

Lessor may use any money paid by or for Lessee towards meeting any part Lessor chooses of the amounts Lessee owes Lessor (including meeting any amount the Guarantor does not guarantee).

Lessor may use any money paid by the Guarantor under this guarantee and indemnity towards paying any part Lessor chooses of the amounts the guarantor owes Lessor under this guarantee and indemnity.

Lessor may place in a suspense account any payments Lessor receives from the Guarantor for as long as Lessor thinks prudent.

13.

MISCELLANEOUS 
13.1	Assignment.

LESSEE SHALL NOT ASSIGN ITS RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS, SUBLET THE EQUIPMENT OR OTHERWISE PERMIT THE EQUIPMENT TO BE OPERATED OR USED BY, OR TO COME INTO THE POSSESSION OF, ANYONE BUT LESSEE.

Lessor may assign or transfer any or all of Lessor's interest in this Agreement, any Lease or Financing Transaction, any Equipment or Rents, without notice to Lessee.

Any assignee of Lessor shall have all of the rights, but none of the obligations (unless otherwise provided in the applicable assignment), of a "Lessor" under this Agreement and the applicable Lease or Financing Transaction, and Lessee agrees that it will not assert against any assignee any defense, counterclaim or offset that Lessee may have against Lessor or, and that upon notice of such assignment or transfer, it will pay all Rent and other sums due under this Agreement and the applicable Lease or Financing Transaction to such assignee or transferee.
