IAE ESCALATION FORMULA 1. Any unit base price or other sum expressed to be subject to escalation from a base month to a month of delivery or other date of determination in accordance with the IAE Escalation Formula will be subject to escalation in accordance with the following formula: P = Pb ( [****] L + [****] M + [****] E ) Lo Mo Eo Where: P = the invoiced purchase price or escalated sum rounded to the nearest U.S. Dollar. Pb = unit base price or other sum. Lo = the "Average Hourly Earnings of Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Production Workers" SIC Code 3724 published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor for the month preceding the base month by four months. L = the "Average Hourly Earnings of Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Production Workers" SIC Code 3724 for the month preceding the month of delivery or other date of determination by four months. Mo = the "Producer Price Index, Code 10, for Metals and Metal Products" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor for the month preceding the base month by four months. M = the "Producer Price Index, Code 10, for Metals and Metal Products" for the month preceding the month of delivery or other date of determination by four months. Eo = the "Producer Price Index, Code 5, for Fuel and Related Products and Power" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor for the month preceding the base month by four months. E = the "Producer Price Index, Code 5, for Fuel and Related Products and Power" for the month preceding the month of delivery or other date of determination by four months. 2. The values of the factors [****] L and [****] M and [****] E Lo Mo Eo Page 11 of 43 [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. respectively, shall be determined to the nearest fourth decimal place. If the fifth decimal is five or more, the fourth decimal place shall be raised to the next higher number. 3. If the U.S. Department of Labor ceases to publish the above statistics or modifies the basis of their calculation, then IAE may substitute any officially recognized and substantially equivalent statistics. 4. The Basic Contract Prices contained in this Exhibit B are subject to escalation from a Base Month of January 1999 to the month of delivery using Lo, Mo and Eo values for September 1998. 5. If the application of the formula contained in this Exhibit B results in a Purchase Price which is lower than the Basic Contract Price, the Basic Contract Price will be deemed to be the Purchase Price for such Supplies.

ELIGIBLE SHOP VISITS Eligible Shop Visits shall comprise the shop visits of Eligible Engines required for the following reasons: 1. a Failure of a Part in such Eligible Engines; 2. foreign object damage caused by the ingestion of birds, hailstones or runway gravel; Page 14 of 43 [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 3. an Airworthiness Directive issued by the applicable Certification Authority; 4. maintenance as recommended by IAE; and 5. removal for LLP time expiration so long as minimum build cycle requirement pursuant to the Maintenance Management Plan is adhered to. D. REPORTING OF ENGINE SHOP VISITS AND ENGINE FLIGHT HOURS Eligible Shop Visits shall be reported to IAE by JetBlue within thirty days after the date of such Engine Shop Visit using IAE Form SVR Rev 1, July 95 together with such other information as may be needed to determine the Eligibility of the Engine Shop Visit. Each such Form shall be verified by an authorized IAE Representative before submission. Should it be necessary for him to disqualify a reported Engine Shop Visit, supporting information will be furnished. Flight hours accumulated by Eligible Engines during each month during the Period of Guarantee shall be reported by JetBlue within thirty days after each month's end to IAE on IAE Form SVR Rev 1, July 95 unless other procedures are established for the reporting of flight hours. E. CREDIT ALLOWANCE CALCULATION A credit of [****] U.S. Dollars will be granted by IAE for each Eligible Engine Shop Visit determined as calculated below to be in excess of the Guaranteed Rate during the Period of Guarantee. An annual calculation will be made no later than sixty days after each yearly anniversary of the commencement of the Period of Guarantee provided that the necessary Engine Shop Visit records and Eligible Engine flight hour information have been reported to IAE. Each annual calculation will be made using data that will be cumulative from the start of the Period of Guarantee. An interim credit will be granted, if necessary, following the annual calculations for the second year and each subsequent year of the Period of Guarantee. If subsequent annual calculations show that on a cumulative basis, a previous interim credit (or portion thereof) was excessive, such excess amount shall be subject to repayment which will be effected by IAE issuing a debit against JetBlue's account with IAE. Credits and debits will be applied to JetBlue's Air's account with IAE not later than thirty days following a calculation for the second year and each subsequent year of the Period of Guarantee, as applicable. Page 15 of 43 [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Credit Allowance = (AR GR) x [****] U.S. Dollars where: AR = Total Eligible Engine Shop Visits during the period of the calculation. GR = [****]/1,000 x total Engine flight hours accumulated on Eligible Engines during the period of the calculation. (NOTE: GR will be rounded to the nearest whole number.) III DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL CONDITIONS All of the Definitions and General Conditions of the V2500 Engine and Parts excluded by the General Conditions of the Policy shall be excluded from this Guarantee except that Engine Shop Visits resulting from ingestion of birds, hailstones or runway gravel shall be included as Eligible under this Guarantee.

Page 16 of 43 [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. C. In the event credits are issued under Section II, such credits will be dedicated to the procurement of Parts aimed at correction of the situations contributing to excess Engine Shop Visits. Accordingly, JetBlue and IAE will establish jointly the modifications or Parts to be selected, and JetBlue will incorporate the changes into Eligible Engines. V EXCLUSION OF BENEFITS The intent of this Guarantee is to provide specified benefits to JetBlue as a result of the failure of Eligible Engines to achieve the reliability level stipulated in the Guarantee. It is not the intent, however, to duplicate benefits provided JetBlue under any other applicable guarantee, sales warranty, service policy, or any special benefit of any kind as a result of the same failure. Therefore, the terms and conditions of this Guarantee notwithstanding, if the terms of this Guarantee should make duplicate benefits available to JetBlue from IAE or any thirdparty, JetBlue may elect to receive the benefits under this Guarantee or under any of the other benefits described above, but not both.
