This technology will void any image caching the end user may be using and can effectively increase ad inventory of the client's site. Integration The Ad Serving Software has been coded with integration in mind. Our software can be integrated into other banner exchanges. This is an integral feature, as ad auctioning rivals get a great deal of their sales (and ad inventory) from banner exchange sites. Instead of a client inserting the typical image and link code onto their site, the client will place our scripts, creating "two layers" of banner exchanging. This ability will allow us to easily audit statistics and keep track of how the site is showing the buyer's banners. This will also allow us to compare statistics with the seller's site and make sure there aren't any discrepancies, ultimately creating a very strong and fair way of reporting ad campaign statistics. Advanced Tracking, Fraud Busting and Statistics The Ad Serving Software keeps a wide range of important statistics. This will ensure that the banners are not being requested en mass from the same IP number (same person), that the times and dates of banner requests from IP numbers are appropriate. The software makes it increasingly difficult to engineer a site to get more clickthroughs or exposures than they deserve. Control The seller of banners (web publisher) will be able to easily verify the validity of a buyer's banner to make sure it is appropriate for their site. The web publisher will be able to reject a banner if they deem it to be inappropriate. Relevant statistics will be available for the ad buyer, seller and the administrators. 86 Customized Profiles The software features customized profiles for buyers and sellers, allowing them to "get to know each other" a little better before deciding on a sale. Multiple Ads The software has the ability for the buyer to display multiple banners per campaign, and compare the statistics of the banners to each other. This allows buyers to decide which type of advertisement is working best for them. Advanced Email Manager Future advancements to the software will include a fully integrated email manager, allowing for announcement lists for clients, and to notify the user base of important changes, deals, and features. Server Technology Ebidd.com will be running the ad serving software on a dedicated server, allowing for maximum load usage and bandwidth. The software was created in Perl and the webserver will be running Apache with ModPerl. Apache is the most popular webserver on the Internet, with over 60% of all websites running Apache. It is efficient, popular, and secure. Mod Perl is an extension for Apache that allows it to "cache" Perl CGI files. This will allow our Perl scripts to execute 2050% faster, greatly decreasing the load on the host server. Scaleable Database Technology We are using mySQL as a database server. (SQL = Structured Query Language) SOL is the most widely used database language in the world, with the portability of Perl scripts to accessing mySQL, we will be able to change over to a more extensive database solution if the need arises. Security EBidd.com will provides the server with maximum security. For Credit Card transactions, we will be using Apache's SSL layers. EBidd.com will also be utilizing an established merchant account solution for Internet Based commerce transactions. 87
