CLAUSE 4 WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES AND LIABILITIES 4.1 IAE warrants to New Air that, at the time of delivery, the Supplies sold hereunder will be free of defects in material and manufacture, and will conform substantially to applicable specifications. IAE's liability and New Air's remedies under this warranty are limited to the repair or replacement, at IAE's election, of Supplies or parts thereof returned to IAE at the factory of manufacture which are shown to IAE's reasonable satisfaction to have been defective; provided, that written notice of the defect shall have been given by New Air to IAE within ninety (90) days after the first operation or use of the Supplies (or if the Supplies are installed in new Aircraft, within ninety (90) days after acceptance of such Aircraft by its first operator) but in no event later than one (1) year after the date of delivery of such Supplies by IAE. Transportation charges for the return of Supplies to IAE pursuant to this Clause 4.1 and their reshipment to New Air and the risk of loss thereof will be borne by IAE only if the Supplies are returned in accordance with written shipping instructions from IAE and judged by IAE to be defective. 4.2 In addition, IAE grants and New Air accepts the following: 4.2.1 V2500 Engine and Parts Service Policy [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

The above Service Policies, Warranties and Guarantees together form Exhibit D to this Contract. 4.3 The parties agree that those of the Warranties set out in Clauses 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 above shall apply to any equipment which falls within the type of equipment covered by those Warranties, which are manufactured, supplied or inspected by IAE howsoever and whenever (whether before, on or after the date first above written) acquired by New Air from whatsoever source including but not limited to any V2500 aero engines and any associated equipment therefor, and any parts for such engines and associated equipment which form part of any aircraft acquired from the manufacturer. 4.4 The Warranties are personal to New Air and the obligations of IAE thereunder shall only apply insofar as New Air owns and operates the Supplies covered thereunder. 4.5 New Air shall inform any entity to whom it intends to sell, lease, loan or otherwise dispose of any of the Supplies or equipment referred to in Clause 4.3 above that such entity may obtain from IAE a direct warranty agreement incorporating those of the Warranties set out in Clauses 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. New Air shall also use its reasonable endeavors to ensure that such entity shall enter into a direct warranty agreement with IAE prior to delivery of any of the Supplies or such equipment to such entity. 4.6 IAE and New Air agree that the intent of the Warranties provided in Clause 4.2 is to provide specified benefits or remedies to New Air as a result of specified events. It is not the intent, however, to duplicate benefits or remedies provided to New Air by IAE or another source (e.g., another equipment manufacturer or lessor) as a result of the same event or cause. Therefore, notwithstanding the terms of the Warranties, New Air agrees that it shall not be eligible to receive benefits or remedies from IAE if it stands to receive or has received duplicate benefits or remedies from IAE or another source as a result of the same event or cause. Furthermore, in no event shall Page 18 of 131 IAE be required to provide duplicate benefits to New Air and any other party such as a leasing company as a result of the same event or cause. 4.7 New Air accepts that the Warranties granted to New Air under Clauses 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above together with the express remedies provided to New Air in respect of the Supplies in accordance with this Contract are expressly in lieu of, and New Air hereby waives, all other remedies, conditions and warranties, expressed or implied including without limitation, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and all other obligations and liabilities whatsoever of IAE and of its shareholders whether in contract or in tort or otherwise for any defect, deficiency, failure, malfunctioning or failure to function of any item of the Supplies or of the equipment referred to in Clause 4.3 above, howsoever and whenever acquired by New Air from whatever sources. New Air agrees that neither IAE nor any of its shareholders shall be liable to New Air upon any claim therefor or upon any claim howsoever arising out of the manufacture or supply or inspection by IAE or any of its shareholders of any item of the Supplies or of such equipment or any other item of whatever nature, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, except as expressly provided in the said Warranties, and New Air assumes all risk and liability whatsoever not expressly assumed by IAE in the said Warranties. 4.8 IAE and New Air agree that this Clause 4 has been the subject of discussion and negotiation, is fully understood by the parties and the price of the Supplies and other mutual agreements of the parties set forth in this Contract are arrived at in consideration of: 4.8.1 the express Warranties of IAE and New Air's rights thereunder; and 4.8.2 the exclusions, waivers and limitations set forth in Clause 4.7 above. CLAUSE 5 PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES 5.1 IAE will make available to New Air the Product Support Services described in Exhibit C to this Contract. Except when identified in such Exhibit C as being at additional cost or as requiring separate contractual arrangements, such Product Support Services shall be supplied at no additional charge to New Air and subject to the provisions of this Contract. IAE may delegate the performance of product support services to an affiliated company or any of IAE's shareholders. 5.2 New Air will provide to any IAE customer support representative(s) working at its facility, free of charge: (a) reasonable, secure office accommodation including furniture and office equipment and (b) access to telephone, facsimile and secretarial services and Page 19 of 131 (c) access to such firstaid and emergency assistance as is customarily provided to New Air's own employees and (d) airfare, accommodations, and subsistence during any period in which the customer support representative(s) is required by New Air to travel away from such customer support representative(s)' normal location at New Air. New Air further agrees that such customer support representative(s) will be entitled to all reasonable working benefits allowed pursuant to normal IAE practice, including but not limited to, leaves of absence relating to vacation, holiday and sick time. CLAUSE 6 MISCELLANEOUS 6.1 DELAY IN DELIVERY 6.1.1 If IAE is hindered or prevented from performing any obligation hereunder including but not limited to delivering any of the Supplies within the time for delivery specified in this Contract (as such time may be extended pursuant to the provisions of this Contract) by reason of: 6.1.1.1 any cause beyond the reasonable control of IAE, or 6.1.1.2 fires, industrial disputes or introduction of essential modifications the time for delivery shall be extended by a period equal to the period for which delivery shall have been so hindered or prevented, and IAE shall not be under any liability whatsoever in respect of such delay. 6.1.2 If, by reason of any of the causes embraced by Clause 6.1.1 above, IAE is hindered or prevented from delivering any goods (which are the same as and include the Supplies) to purchasers (including New Air) then IAE shall have the right to allocate in good faith such goods, as they become available, at its own discretion among all such purchasers and IAE shall not be under any liability whatsoever to New Air for delay in delivery to New Air resulting from such allocation by IAE and the time for delivery shall be extended by a period equal to the delay resulting from such allocation by IAE. 6.1.3 Should IAE inexcusably delay performance of any obligation hereunder including but not limited to delivery of any item of the Supplies beyond the time for delivery specified in this Contract (as such time may be extended pursuant to the provisions of this Contract), then in respect of the first two (2) months of such delay, IAE shall not be under any liability whatsoever and thereafter in respect of any further delay in delivery the damages recoverable by New Air from IAE as New Air's sole remedy shall be its reasonable actual damages in an amount not to exceed [****] of the purchase price of the item of Supplies so delayed in respect of each [****] such further delay (and prorata for any period of less than [****]) subject [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Page 20 of 131 to an overall maximum of [****] of the purchase price of the item of the Supplies so delayed. 6.1.4 The right of New Air to claim damages shall be conditional upon the submission of a written claim therefor, within fortyfive (45) days from the date on which IAE notifies New Air that the item of the Supplies so delayed is ready for delivery, or from the date on which New Air exercises the right of cancellation in respect of such item conferred in accordance with Clause 6.1.5 below, whichever date shall first occur. 6.1.5 Should IAE delay performance of any obligation hereunder including but not limited to delivery of any item of the Supplies beyond twelve (12) months from the time for delivery specified in this Contract (as such time may be extended pursuant to the provisions of this Contract) then, in addition to the right of New Air under Clause 6.1.3, New Air shall be entitled to refuse to take delivery of such item on giving IAE notice in writing within one (1) month after the expiration of such period of twelve (12) months. Upon receipt of such notice IAE shall be free from any obligation in respect of such item except that IAE shall refund to New Air any deposits made in respect of the purchase price of such item of the Supplies. 6.2 PATENTS 6.2.1 IAE shall, subject to the conditions set out in this Clause and as the sole liability of IAE in respect of any claims for infringement of industrial property rights, indemnify New Air against any claim that the use of any of the Supplies by New Air within any country to which at the date of such claim the benefits of Article 27 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation of 7th December 1944 (The Chicago Convention) apply, infringes any patent, design, or model duly granted or registered provided, however, that IAE shall not be liable to New Air for any consequential damage or any loss of use of the Supplies or of the Aircraft in which the Supplies may be incorporated arising as a result directly or indirectly of any such claim. 6.2.2 New Air will give immediate notice in writing to IAE of any such claim whereupon IAE shall have the right at its own expense to assume the defense of or to dispose of or to settle such claim in its sole discretion and New Air will give IAE all reasonable assistance and will not by any act or omission do anything which may directly or indirectly prejudice IAE in this connection. 6.2.3 IAE shall have the right to substitute for any allegedly infringing Supplies substantially equivalent noninfringing supplies. 6.2.4 The indemnity contained in Clause 6.2.1 above shall not apply to claims for infringement in respect of (i) Supplies manufactured to the specific design instructions of New Air; (ii) Supplies not of IAE design (but IAE shall in the event of any claim for infringement pass on to New Air so far as it has the right to do so the benefits of any indemnity given to IAE by the designer, [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Page 21 of 131 manufacturer or supplier of such Supplies) (iii) the manner or method in which any of the Supplies is installed in the Aircraft; or (iv) any combination of any of the Supplies with any item or items other than Supplies. 6.3 CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT AND ASSIGNMENT; 6.3.1 If New Air does not take delivery of the twentyfive (25) Firm Aircraft, the five (5) Firm Spare Engines and, PRO RATA to the extent that Option Aircraft are acquired, the eight (8) Option Spare Engines (each Firm Aircraft, Firm Spare Engine and Option Spare Engine equally a "Firm Item") in accordance with the schedules described in Exhibit B to the Contract (as such may be modified or supplemented pursuant to the terms of the Contract) then, without prejudice to IAE's other rights and remedies under the Contract or otherwise, the value of each and every credit, benefit and other concession received by New Air pursuant to the Contract (including all Side Letters and amendments thereto) or from IAE via the Aircraft Manufacturer will be adjusted to prorata amounts, based on the ratio of the number of Firm Items (whether Aircraft or Spare Engines) purchased in accordance with the schedules described in Exhibit B to the Contract to the total number of Firm Items scheduled to have been so purchased. So, for example, if IAE is to issue credits on delivery of each Firm Item and New Air takes delivery of only half the total number of such Firm Items (whether or not with the consent of Airbus) the value of each credit to be issued on the Firm Items actually taken and all other credits (if any) will be reduced by half. Following such adjustment, New Air will promptly reimburse IAE in an amount equal to (a) the value of the credits benefits and other concessions actually provided in excess of the adjusted amounts, plus (b) the interest on such excess amounts calculated from the time each respective amount was applied or value received until reimbursement. Interest will be calculated at [****] at the time each respective amount was applied or value was received. 6.3.2 RIGHT OF SETOFF IAE shall have the right to set off credits from time to time made available by IAE under the Contract either directly to New Air (or its affiliates) or via the Aircraft Manufacturer or its affiliates, in respect of the failure by New Air (or its affiliates), after any applicable grace period, to cure any payment default under (x) the Contract or (y) any IAE financing agreement with New Air for the Aircraft. 6.4 NONDISCLOSURE AND NONUSE 6.4.1 Subject to Clause 6.4.3 below, New Air agrees not to disclose to any third party (other than professional advisers of such party who agree to abide in advance by the nondisclosure requirements set forth in this Clause 6.4) any Information which it acquires directly or indirectly from IAE and agrees not to use the same other than for the purpose for which it was disclosed without [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

New Air shall restrict disclosure of all information and data furnished under this Contract in obtaining such licenses, permits, or authorizations. New Air shall only ship the Supplies and information and data furnished under this Contract to those destinations permitted under such licenses, permits, or authorizations. 6.4.5 In the event that any of the Information as described in Clause 6.4.1 is required to be disclosed by New Air through a valid governmental, judicial or regulatory agency order, New Air agrees to advise IAE of the need for disclosure (in advance of such disclosure when possible) and to limit the disclosure to only those portions of the Information specifically required to be disclosed by such order, and to maintain the confidentiality of as much of the Information as legally possible. 6.5 TAXES 6.5.1 Subject to Clause 6.5.2 below, IAE shall pay all imposts, duties, fees, taxes and other like charges levied by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan or any agency thereof in connection with the Supplies prior to their delivery. 6.5.2 All amounts stated to be payable by New Air pursuant to this Contract exclude any value added tax, sales tax or taxes on turnover. In the event that the supply of goods or services under this Contract is chargeable to any value added tax, sales tax or taxes on turnover such tax will be borne by New Air. To ensure so far as possible that New Air is not charged with European Community value added tax ("VAT"), New Air will within 30 days of signature hereof, inform IAE of its VAT Code (if any) for inclusion on IAE's invoices. 6.5.3 New Air shall pay all other imposts, duties, fees, taxes and other like charges by whomsoever levied.

SPARE PARTS 5.1 SPARE PARTS SUPPORT The Spare Parts Group provides the following categories of spare parts support to airline customers: Individual Customer Account Representatives Provisioning Planning Order Administration Spare Parts Inventory Effective Expedite Service Worldwide Distribution 5.1.1 ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVE: An Account Representative is assigned to each customer using IAE equipment. This representative provides individualized attention for effective spare parts order administration, and is the customer's interface on all matters pertaining to new part planning and procurement. Each representative is responsible for monitoring each assigned customer's requirements and providing effective administrative support. The Account Representatives are thoroughly familiar with each customer's spare parts ordering policies and procedures and are responsible for ensuring that all customer new parts orders are processed in an effective manner. 5.1.2 SPARE PARTS PROVISIONING PLANNING: Prior to delivery of the first new aircraft to an airline customer, preplanning discussions will be held to determine the aircraft/engine program, and engine spare parts provisioning and order plans. Mutually agreed upon provisioning target dates are then established and ontime completion tracked by the Customer Account Representative with the assistance of logistics specialists in Spare Parts Provisioning and Inventory Management. Meetings are held with airline customers at a mutually agreeable time to review suggested spare parts provisioning lists prepared by spare parts Provisioning. These lists are designed to support each customer's particular fleet size, route structure and maintenance and overhaul program. Page 64 of 131 5.1.3 ORDER ADMINISTRATION: IAE subscribes to the general principles of Air Transport Association of America (ATA) Specification No. 2000, Integrated Data Processing Supply. The procedures of Air Transport Association of America (ATA) Specification No. 200 may be used for Initial Provisioning (Chapter II), Order Administration (either Chapter III or Chapter VI), or Invoicing (Chapter IV). A spare parts supply objective is to maintain a 90 percent ontime shipment performance record to customer requirements. The lead time for replenishment spare parts is identified in the IAE spare Parts Price Catalog. Initial provisioning spare parts orders should be placed at least six months prior to required delivery, while conversions and major modifications require full manufacturing lead times. The action to be taken on emergency requests will be answered as follows: AircraftOnGround (AOG) within four hours (in these instances every effort is made to ship immediately). Critical (Imminent AircraftOnGround (AOG) or Work Stoppage) Within 24 hours. Stock Outage Within seven working days (these items are shipped as per customer request). 5.1.4 SPARE PARTS INVENTORY: To ensure availability of spare parts in accordance with published lead time, spare parts provisioning maintains a modern, comprehensive requirements planning and inventory management system which is responsive to changes in customer demand, special support programs and engineering design. Organized on an engine model basis, this system is intended to maintain part availability for delivery to customers consistent with published lead times. A majority of parts in the spare parts inventory are continually controlled by an Automatic Forecasting and Ordering System. Those parts which do not lend themselves to automatic control due to supercedure, unusual usage or conversion requirements are under the direct manual control of Spares Planning personnel. As additional protection against changes in production lead time or unpredicted demand, certain raw materials are also inventoried. Successful inventory management is keyed to accurate requirements planning. In support of the requirements planning effort, a wide ranging data retrieval and analysis program is offered. This program concerns itself both with the customer logistics and technical considerations as follows: Page 65 of 131 Forecasts of life limited parts requirements are requested and received semiannually from major customers. . Engine technical conferences are held frequently within IAE to assess the impact of technical problems on parts. For a selected group of parts a provisioning conference system is offered which considers actual part inventory change, including usage and receipts, as reported monthly by participating customers. 5.1.5 PACKAGING All material is packaged in general compliance with Air Transport Association of America (ATA) Specification No. 300. 5.1.6 WORLD AIRLINE SUPPLIER'S GUIDE: IAE subscribes to the supply objectives set forth in the World Airlines Supplier's Guide published by the Air Transport Association of America (ATA). IAE requires that its proprietary component vendors also perform in compliance with the precepts of the World Airline Suppliers' Guide.

III. DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL CONDITIONS All of the Definitions and General Conditions of the V2500 Engine and Parts Service Policy shall apply to this Guarantee. Engines and Engine Maintenance excluded by the General Conditions of the Policy shall be excluded from this Guarantee except that Engine Maintenance resulting from ingestion of birds, hailstones or runway gravel shall be included as Eligible under this Guarantee. IV. SPECIFIC CONDITIONS A. The Guaranteed Cost Rate is predicated on the use by New Air of: 1. An average flight cycle of no less than [****] hours; 2. Thrust levels which are derated an average of [****] for Takeoff relative to full Takeoff ratings; 3. An average Aircraft utilization equal to or less than [****] flight hours per year; 4. An Aircraft and Engine delivery schedule in respect of thirtytwo (32) Aircraft (composed of twentyfive (25) Firm Aircraft and seven (7) Leased Aircraft) and seven (7) spare Engines as described in the Proposal or Contract to which this Guarantee is attached; and 5.

Page 130 of 131 B. IAE reserves the right to make appropriate adjustments to the Guaranteed Rate if there is, during the Period of Guarantee, (a) a variation from the conditions upon which the Guaranteed Rate is predicated, or (b) a discontinuation of ownership by New Air of any Engine or any V2500 powered Aircraft subsequent to delivery to New Air, or (c) if New Air takes Option Aircraft or Option Spare Engines. C. In the event credits are issued under Section II, Paragraph F, such credits will be dedicated to the procurement of parts aimed at correction of the situations contributing to excess Engine Maintenance Costs. Accordingly, New Air and IAE will establish jointly the modifications or Parts to be selected, and New Air will incorporate the changes into Eligible Engines. V EXCLUSION OF BENEFITS The intent of this Guarantee is to provide specified benefits to New Air as a result of the failure of Eligible Engines to achieve the maintenance cost level stipulated in the Guarantee. It is not the intent, however, to duplicate benefits provided to New Air under any other applicable guarantee, sales warranty, service policy, or any special benefit of any kind as a result of the same failure. Therefore, the terms and conditions of this Guarantee notwithstanding, if the terms of this Guarantee should make duplicate benefits available to New Air from IAE or any thirdparty, New Air may elect to receive the benefits under this Guarantee or under any of the other benefits described above, but not both.
