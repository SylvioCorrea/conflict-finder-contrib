NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises and mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: AGREEMENTS 1. Services. (a) Manufacture and Packaging of Products. FFG shall, either directly or by outsourcing to a thirdparty under the supervision of FFG, manufacture and package for BRIAZZ all food products sold by BRIAZZ or any of its affiliates during the term hereof in all market areas in which BRIAZZ operates (collectively, the "Products"), in accordance with the manufacturing procedures, the product specifications, packaging instructions, and quality control procedures set forth in this Agreement. The current BRIAZZ menu of Products consists of approximately one hundred (100) salad and sandwich SKU's of which approximately twenty percent (20%) are USDA items as currently defined. Upon prior reasonable notice to FFG, BRIAZZ may change items on the menu provided, however, that the total quantity of items and proportion of the items which are USDA items must remain approximately the same. For the term of this Agreement, FFG shall have the right of first refusal to manufacture and package food products for BRIAZZ in any new markets that BRIAZZ may enter. (b) ThirdParty Distribution. FFG will from time to time upon request of BRIAZZ, provide BRIAZZ with purchasing, warehousing and storage of food products, packaging and other services as mutually agreed to between the parties. 2. Transfer of Production to FFG Facilities and Startup. (a) Transfer of Production. BRIAZZ agrees to transfer production of the Products in the following market areas to FFG, and FFG agrees to manufacture and package the Products in such market areas, by the following dates, subject to FFG's kitchen facility for such market becoming USDA certified: Chicago, Illinois December 1, 2002 Los Angeles, California December 8, 2002 Seattle, Washington March 2, 2003 San Francisco, California March 2, 2003 The parties agree that FFG has obtained USDA certifications for each of the Chicago and Los Angeles market areas. If FFG is unable to take responsibility for food production such that BRIAZZ is unable to close its commissaries in Seattle and/or San Francisco by March 1, 2003, FFG shall pay to BRIAZZ the actual costs incurred by BRIAZZ of foregoing a potential sublet opportunity, not to exceed $50,000 for each market. (b) BRIAZZ Kitchen Equipment. At FFG'srequest, BRIAZZ will transfer to FFG any BRIAZZowned kitchen equipment requested by FFG freeofcharge for the term of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated within one (1) year following commencement of production of Products, FFG will return the equipment to BRIAZZ; otherwise the parties agree that any such equipment used beyond one year will have nominal value and can be disposed of as FFG determines in its sole discretion. 3. Term. Unless sooner terminated under the terms hereof, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for a period of ten (10) years from the date hereof. Thereafter, it shall automatically be renewed for successive one year terms unless either party shall deliver written notice to the other of termination not less than three hundred sixtyfive (365) days prior to the end of the initial term or renewal term in question. 4. Purchase Orders and Delivery. BRIAZZ will transmit to FFG daily orders for Products and services to be provided by FFG. BRIAZZ and FFG will mutually agree on required ordering and delivery times. All orders shall be confirmed or rejected by FFG within one (1) hour of receipt of such order. FFG will use its best efforts to confirm and provide all Products and services ordered by BRIAZZ and will advise the specific reasons for any rejected order. All orders shall be shipped and provided F.O.B. FFG docks of the FFG facility in the market area in which the order is placed. 5. Cost and Pricing. (a) Food ProductionPhase I (Transition Period). For the first week of production, Briazz will reimburse FFG for all operating costs (including moving, equipment relocation and set up costs). For the next one hundred twenty (120) days for Chicago and Los Angeles, and for the next sixty (60) days for Seattle and San Francisco (such periods referred herein to as the "Transition Period" for such applicable FFG facility), FFG will charge BRIAZZ for Products produced at such FFG facility based on a formula consisting of: (i) Direct Costs; plus (ii) a fee of ten percent (10%) of the Direct Costs. The term "Direct Costs" shall mean all costs incurred by FFG in producing the Products; provided, however, Direct Costs shall not exceed BRIAZZ's most recent comparable costs. BRIAZZ's most recent comparable costs shall be the CK operating costs (before occupancy) for BRIAZZ's two (2) reporting periods prior to transition to the applicable FFG facility, as reflected in BRIAZZ's financial statements for those 2 periods or subject to mutual agreement by the parties. Direct Costs shall include, but not be limited to: (i) food, product and packaging costs, including, allocation for COGS variance; (ii) direct labor costs (including benefits and taxes) associated with food production; (iii) incremental direct labor costs for related kitchen functions (e.g., clerical, storeroom, , storage and warehousing); (iv) incremental management salary costs (including benefits and taxes) for one manager (additional management may be added subject to mutual agreeement) necessary for production of BRIAZZ's products and services; (v) direct operating costs (e.g., uniforms) to be agreed upon by FFG and BRIAZZ; and (vi) incremental USDA costs. (b) Food ProductionPhase II (PostTransition Period). FFG will complete costing and proposed pricing for all Products and services to be provided to BRIAZZ from a particular FFG Facility prior to the expiration of the Transition Period for such facility. FFG and BRIAZZ will agree on prices to be charged for all Products and services within thirty (30) days after FFG submits such pricing to BRIAZZ, and these prices will replace the costplus arrangement in Section 5(a) above. The four components of pricing include: (i) food and packaging costs (adjusted for Shared Savings); (ii) direct labor costs for food production and incremental labor costs for related kitchen functions; (iii) incremental operating costs (e.g., uniforms, utilities, USDA costs); and (iv) profit. BRIAZZ has generated ingredient product costs ("Standard Costs") for all of its items. If FFG is able to produce items in accordance with this Agreement at a price lower than the Standard Costs, savings will be shared equally between BRIAZZ and FFG (the "Shared Savings"). BRIAZZ and FFG agree to meet at least biannually to review costs and identify Shared Savings. (c) ThirdParty Distribution Services. For any thirdparty distribution service that BRIAZZ requests FFG to perform, FFG will change BRIAZZ the actual costs incurred to render such service plus a handling charge of five percent (5%) of the cost of the products handled. 3 6. Invoicing and Payment. FFG shall issue a weekly statement dated the last day of each weekly period summarizing all daily orders for the week setting forth the name, quantity and cost of each item delivered and services provided and the payment amount due. BRIAZZ shall make payment for each weekly invoice statement within seven (7) days of invoice statement date with respect to the Los Angeles market and within fourteen (14) days of invoice statement date with respect to all other markets. 7. Quality Assurance. (a) FFG warrants that: (i) that the Products, including food articles, food ingredients, food packaging, and food labeling relating to or comprising the Products or any part thereof delivered, sold or transferred to BRIAZZ hereunder shall be in full compliance with all applicable federal statutes, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, with the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the USDA, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FP& L Act), the Nutritional Labeling & Education Act (NLEA), all current and future amendments thereto, and all regulations and rules implemented thereunder now and in the future; (ii) that the Products shall be manufactured, stored and delivered, and the condiments shall be stored and delivered, in accordance with appropriate "Good Manufacturing Practices" or similar practices that may be promulgated under the aforementioned acts, amendments, regulations, rules, as applicable, and in accordance with all state laws and local health and sanitary ordinances or regulations; (iii) that the Products shall be manufactured, stored, and delivered, and the condiments shall be stored and delivered, in accordance with a Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Point ("HACCP") program (as defined below). As used in this Agreement, a HACCP program means a program to identify critical control points in the production and delivery process to prevent physical, microbiological and chemical adulteration of the Products. The critical control points in the HACCP program must have established tolerances and must be measured at fixed intervals. The HACCP program requires supplier to establish and maintain reasonable written records to confirm supplier's compliance with the program, including written instructions to supplier's agents and employees for properly handling Products which are found to be outside the critical control limits. These warranties shall be in addition to all other warranties, express, implied or statutory and in addition to all obligations contained in this Agreement.

BRIAZZ agrees that such inspections shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations of FFG. In the event that a Product(s) does not conform to the specifications or BRIAZZ's Food Safety and Quality Assurance Standards described in Section 7(a) above, BRIAZZ shall be permitted to reject all nonconforming shipments and services and shall be entitled to, at BRIAZZ's option, replacement Product(s) or reimbursements for the actual costs (including shipping and delivery costs) of the Product(s). (c) OTHER THAN THAT SET FORTH IN SECTION 7(a) above, FFG MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EXCEPT FOR THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY.
