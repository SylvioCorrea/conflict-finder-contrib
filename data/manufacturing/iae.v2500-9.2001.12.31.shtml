Acceptance by JetBlue of this credit from IAE shall be deemed for this Contract confirmation of JetBlue's acceptance of the corresponding spare Engine. 3.4 IAE agrees to make reasonable efforts to effect delivery of the Purchased Items under Clause 2.5.1 ExWorks (INCOTERMS 1990) Connecticut, U.S.A." 5. CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND REIMBURSEMENT a. JetBlue and IAE hereby agree that if JetBlue fails to take scheduled delivery of any Firm Aircraft or informs IAE or Airbus, or IAE in its sole discretion determines, that it will not take scheduled delivery, of any or all of such Aircraft, then IAE will promptly discontinue the issuance of the Third Deal Advanced Credits to JetBlue and JetBlue will promptly repay to IAE (i) all FIA Credits (as such advanced credits are defined in Side Letter No. 8) not yet Page 4 of 14 [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. repaid according to the terms of Side Letter No. 8 and (ii) all Third Deal Advanced Credits already paid to JetBlue, subject to the limitations in 5.b. below, with interest as set forth herein. Scheduled delivery is herein defined as delivery in accordance with the delivery schedule attached as Exhibit B1 to this Side Letter No. 9. In addition, if: (i) The present ownership of JetBlue, or a portion thereof which is greater than 50 percent of the present ownership is transferred to a third party, or there has been a change in the beneficial ownership of the total voting power of all classes of stock then outstanding which are normally entitled to vote in the election of JetBlue's directors. If JetBlue can demonstrate to the satisfaction of IAE that the surviving company resulting from the transfer is at least as credit worthy as JetBlue prior to such transfer then IAE will waive its rights under this Paragraph (i). (ii) JetBlue fails to make payment of any indebtedness for borrowed money which, in the aggregate, is greater than U.S.$[****] (or its equivalent in other currencies) when due (subject to any applicable period of grace) or any default or event of default occurs which causes such indebtedness to become, or to permit any person to declare the same, due prior to its normally maturity and such person has not waived its right to declare the same due. (iii) JetBlue commences any case, proceeding or other action with respect to JetBlue or its property in any jurisdiction relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, windingup, or relief from, or with respect to, or readjustment of, debts or obligations. (iv) JetBlue seeks the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or other similar official for JetBlue for all or substantially all of its assets, or JetBlue makes a general assignment for the benefit or its creditors. (v) JetBlue otherwise becomes the object of any case, proceeding or action of the type referred to in the preceding clauses (iii) or (iv) which remains unstayed, undismissed or undischarged for a period of sixty (60) days. (vi) An action is commenced against JetBlue seeking issuance of a warrant of attachment, execution, distraint or similar process against all or any substantial part of its assets which remains unstayed, undismissed or undischarged for a period of sixty (60) days; or Page 5 of 14 [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. (vii) In the opinion of IAE, a material adverse change has occurred with respect to the financial condition or operations of JetBlue since the date of this side letter. Then, in the event that any of the conditions listed in the above paragraphs (i) through (vii) occur, JetBlue will no longer receive: 1) any Third Deal Advanced Credits as described in this Side Letter. JetBlue will instead immediately pay IAE in immediately available funds (i) all FIA Credit amounts already advanced and not yet repaid, and (ii) all Third Deal Advanced Credits, subject to the limitations in 5.b. below, together with interest on the late payment of any such amounts at [****] ([****]%), such rate to be determined as of the date that the original payments were due. An interest penalty for late payment will be applied from the date such FIA Credits (as such advanced credits are defined in Side Letter No. 8) or Third Deal Advanced Credits were due to be paid to IAE until the date that IAE receives payment therfor. b. In the event that the repayment of the Third Deal Advanced Credits is triggered pursuant to the foregoing Clause 5.a., the amount of Third Deal Advanced Credits not requiring repayment to IAE is based upon the ratio of Third Deal Aircraft delivered in accordance with the schedule in Exhibit B1 to the number of Third Deal Aircraft firmly ordered by JetBlue. Such ratio will be calculated at the time the repayment is triggered as provided above. So, for example, if at the time repayment is triggered, JetBlue has taken delivery of [****] out of the ten (10) firmly ordered Third Deal Aircraft, JetBlue will be required to repay IAE [****] ([****]%), with interest as provided above, of the Third Deal Advance Credits provided to JetBlue. Except as expressly amended by this Side Letter No. 9 all provisions of the Contract remain in full force and effect.

IAE ESCALATION FORMULA 1. Any unit base price or other sum expressed to be subject to escalation from a base month to a month of delivery or other date of determination in accordance with the IAE Escalation Formula will be subject to escalation in accordance with the following formula: P = Pb ([****] L + [****] M + [****] E) Lo Mo Eo Where: P = the invoiced purchase price or escalated sum rounded to the nearest U.S. Dollar. Pb = unit base price or other sum. Lo = the "Average Hourly Earnings of Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Production Workers" SIC Code 3724 published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor for the month preceding the base month by four months. L = the "Average Hourly Earnings of Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Production Workers" SIC Code 3724 for the month preceding the month of delivery or other date of determination by four months. Mo = the "Producer Price Index, Code 10, for Metals and Metal Products" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor for the month preceding the base month by four months. M = the "Producer Price Index, Code 10, for Metals and Metal Products" for the month preceding the month of delivery or other date of determination by four months. Eo = the "Producer Price Index, Code 5, for Fuel and Related Products and Power" published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor for the month preceding the base month by four months. E = the "Producer Price Index, Code 5, for Fuel and Related Products and Power" for the month preceding the month of delivery or other date of determination by four months. Page 13 of 14 [****] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 2. The values of the factors [****] L and [****] M and [****] E Lo Mo Eo respectively, shall be determined to the nearest fourth decimal place. If the fifth decimal is five or more, the fourth decimal place shall be raised to the next higher number. 3. If the U.S. Department of Labor ceases to publish the above statistics or modifies the basis of their calculation, then IAE may substitute any officially recognized and substantially equivalent statistics. 4. The Basic Contract Prices contained in this Exhibit B are subject to escalation from a Base Month of January 1999 to the month of delivery using Lo, Mo and Eo values for September 1998. 5. If the application of the formula contained in this Exhibit B results in a Purchase Price which is lower than the Basic Contract Price, the Basic Contract Price will be deemed to be the Purchase Price for such Supplies.
