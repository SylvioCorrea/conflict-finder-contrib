PRIVATE LABEL MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT THIS PRIVATE LABEL MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of this 13th day of November, 2003 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Diatron Messtechnik GmbH., a corporation organized under the laws of Austria and having its principal place of business at Ameisgasse 4951/2A, 1140 Vienna ("Supplier"), and Abaxis, Inc., a California corporation having its principal place of business at 3240 Whipple Road, Union City, California 94587, USA ("Purchaser"). BACKGROUND Supplier is a supplier of hematology analyzers for use in the human and veterinary blood analysis market and Purchaser wishes to purchase Supplier's products for use in the veterinary market. Supplier agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase, the products described below, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, for distribution by Purchaser under its own trademarks and tradenames. AGREEMENT Supplier and Purchaser agree as follows: 1. Purchase and Sale Obligations. 1.1 General. Supplier hereby appoints Purchaser as Supplier's reseller of the products specified on Schedule A (Products) attached to this Agreement and incorporated herein by this reference (the "Products"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser agrees to purchase, and Supplier agrees to sell the Products. With respect to the HMII Hematology Analyzer described on Schedule A (Products) as of the Effective Date, Supplier appoints Purchase as Supplier's exclusive worldwide distributor. The parties may modify the Products subject to this Agreement from time to time by annexing a revised Schedule A (Products) to this Agreement. Supplier agrees that Supplier will not (and will not permit any third party to) distribute any other products of Supplier which are hematology products, in the veterinary market in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and/or in such other geographic territories as the parties may mutually agree in writing. 1.2 Minimum Purchase Commitment and Exclusivity. Purchaser agrees to order from Supplier for delivery during each Contract Year during the term of this Agreement, the minimum number of Products, per Contract Year, as is specified on Schedule B attached hereto and incorporated herein (the "Minimum Purchase Commitment"). Contract Year shall mean each twelve (12)month period commencing with the date Products are first available for Page 1 shipment to Purchaser. Supplier agrees, subject to Purchaser's strict compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement including, without limitation, Purchaser's compliance with the Minimum Purchase Commitment, that it will not, directly or indirectly, knowingly sell products with the same form, fit and function of the Products into the veterinary market in competition with the Products. The failure to meet the Minimum Purchase Commitment shall not constitute an Event of Default as defined in Section 14.2 (Termination Upon Event of Default) of this Agreement unless and/or until the amount Purchaser orders for delivery during any Contract Year falls below seventyfive percent (75%) of the then applicable Minimum Purchase Commitment. Supplier agrees to disclose to Purchaser any inquiries, sales leads or information it receives from potential purchasers of Products in territories set forth in Section 1.1 (General). 1.3 Governmental Rules and Regulations. Supplier's obligation to ship orders to Purchaser under this Agreement shall be subject to Supplier's right and ability to make such sales and obtain required licenses and permits, under all applicable decrees, statutes, rules and regulations of a government and/or agency with competent jurisdiction presently in effect or which may be in effect hereafter. 2. Orders, Payment and Delivery. 2.1 Orders. Purchaser shall order Products from Supplier under this Agreement by submitting to Supplier a written purchase order specifying the Products, quantities and requested delivery dates required to enable Supplier to fill the order. Each purchase order submitted to Supplier is subject to acceptance by Supplier at its offices to which such order was submitted. Supplier shall have no liability to Purchaser with respect to orders which are not accepted by Supplier; provided, however, that Supplier will not unreasonably reject any orders for Products which do not require any modifications or additions, other than the modifications of Supplier's products specified in Section 3.1 (Customization for the Veterinary Market) hereto. Subject to the foregoing, Supplier may reject, in its sole discretion, any order for customized Products. In the event Supplier has not given Purchaser notice of acceptance or rejection of a purchase order within ten (10) business days of receipt thereof, such order shall be deemed accepted. The purpose of the purchase order to be issued under this Agreement is for specifying the Products, quantities and requested delivery dates only; no terms and conditions of Purchaser's purchase orders, Supplier's order acknowledgment or any other document or instrument of Purchaser or Supplier shall be binding upon the other party or amend or modify this Agreement in any manner. 2.2 Prices. The purchase price for Products sold under this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with Schedule A (Products) hereto from the date hereof until the end of the first Contract Year. After the first Contract Year, Supplier may modify the prices for Products, upon notice to the Purchaser; provided such prices do not increase more than five percent (5%) in any one Contract Year, unless justified by cost increases incurred by Supplier from thirdparty suppliers. Supplier agrees to provide Purchaser with ninety (90) days prior written notice of any price change and Supplier agrees to honor the price in effect prior to any notice with respect to orders (i) placed prior to the price change effective date and (ii) not modified or canceled by Purchaser. All sales are F.O.B. Vienna or Budapest (Incoterms 2000). Purchaser agrees to separately pay all expenses incurred by Supplier in the shipment and delivery Page 2 of ordered Products, including without limitation freight charges, import duties and insurance premiums. Purchaser shall determine, in its sole discretion, the price at which Purchaser resells Products to Purchaser's customers. 2.3 Shipment and Delivery. Shipments will be made to the warehouse facilities of Purchaser in Union City, California, USA or Darmstadt, Germany, as designated by Purchaser in advance of each shipment. Shipments will be made by air to Union City and by truck to Darmstadt. In the event Purchaser requests express delivery or shipment by air instead of by truck or by courier service, Purchaser agrees to pay all additional expenses required by such request. Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet Purchaser's requested delivery schedules for Products. For Supplier's first purchase order, the latest shipment date shall be 90 days after receipt of purchase order. In any other event, Supplier agrees to ship the ordered quantity of Products within thirty (30) days after receipt of the applicable purchase order, unless the quantity of Products ordered in such purchase order exceeds the number of products forecasted (pursuant to Section 2.6 (Forecasts)) by twentyfive percent (25%) or greater, in which case, Supplier agrees to ship those Products ordered in excess of the forecast within ninety (90) days after receipt of such purchase order. Should orders for Products exceed Supplier's available inventory, Supplier will allocate its available inventory and make deliveries on such basis as Supplier deems equitable, as agreed to by both parties. Unless otherwise specified in Purchaser's purchase order, Supplier shall be authorized to make deliveries in installments. Purchaser shall make any claims for shortage or damage of Products with the common carrier promptly upon receipt of the order and provide Supplier with written notice of such a claim. Except in the case of negligence on the part of Supplier or Supplier's failure to package Products as set forth below, Supplier will not have responsibility for Products damaged in shipment and Purchaser must handle all claims for damage with the carrier. As between Supplier and Purchaser, Products shall be deemed accepted by Purchaser unless, within ninety (90) days of delivery of the Products, Purchaser affirmatively rejects the Products, by written notice detailing the reasons for rejections. The parties acknowledge that they may mutually agree in writing in the future that the foregoing period of time be reduced. Such reasons for rejection may be nonconformance of the Products to the technical specifications described on Schedule A (Products), damage in connection with bodily injury and property damage arising out of any defect in the Products made intentionally, unintentionally or negligently by Supplier during manufacturing and packaging, and the breach of any material provision of this agreement by Supplier. If no such notice of rejection is received, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted delivery provided, however, the acceptance of delivery shall in no way diminish or affect the product warranty given by Supplier in Section 6 (Warranty and Repairs). If Purchaser rejects a shipment, Purchaser shall promptly return a sample of the defective Product to Supplier in accordance with Supplier's instructions, to enable Supplier to, within thirty (30) days, inspect and determine whether the Product is defective; provided that Purchaser shall retain the rest of the Products pending such determination. It is Purchaser's responsibility to properly store and handle all Products pending inspection and/or return. If rejection was timely effected and Supplier determines the Products to be defective, Supplier agrees to repair or replace the Products or cancel an unpaid invoice or refund the amounts paid with respect to such defective Product which is returned to Supplier, at Supplier's option. Page 3 All shipments shall be accompanied by a quality control release report (the form and contents of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties) for each unit of Product shipped by Supplier. Unless Purchaser requests otherwise, all Products ordered by Purchaser shall be packed for shipment and storage in accordance with Schedule A (Products). It is Purchaser's obligation to notify Supplier of any special packaging requirements (which shall be at Purchaser's expense). 2.4 Payment. Purchaser agrees to pay amounts invoiced by Supplier for Products without offset or deduction for any reason whatsoever except as otherwise provided in Section 2.3 (Shipment and Delivery), within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice payable in Euro. If Purchaser fails to pay any amount when due, Purchaser agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by Supplier in collecting such overdue amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amount at the lesser of one and onehalf percent (11/2%) per month or the greatest amount permitted by applicable law. Supplier reserves the right at any time after Purchaser fails to make any payment within sixty (60) days after the due date, to require payment for all Products delivered hereunder to be made by irrevocable letter of credit. If Supplier elects to have payment made by letter of credit, Purchaser shall select the issuing bank, which must be acceptable to Supplier. Any such letter of credit shall be governed by Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UPC) 500. 2.5 Title and Risk of Loss. Title to and risk of loss of the Products shall pass to Purchaser upon the earlier of delivery of the Products to Purchaser or to a carrier at Supplier's point of shipment. 2.6 Forecasts. Purchaser shall submit a rolling twelve (12)month sales forecast to Supplier every three (3) months on the first day of each calendar quarter first following the Effective Date of this Agreement (or, if the Effective Date of this Agreement is within thirty (30) days before any of such dates, commencing on the second such date after the Effective Date of this Agreement). Such sales forecast shall include expected sales quantities per month, order dates, shipping dates and Product requirements. If the most recent forecast becomes materially inaccurate at any time, Purchaser shall promptly provide Supplier with updated information. The forecast information for months four (4) through twelve (12) of the sales forecast shall be for planning purposes only and Purchaser is not required to purchase the Products projected to be sold on the sales forecast. The Purchaser shall issue a purchase order and purchase the Products included in the first three (3) months of each forecast, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1 (Orders). 3. Substitutions and Modifications; Discontinued Products; Quality Assurance. 3.1 Customization for the Veterinary Market. Supplier agrees to modify Supplier's product in accordance with the technical specifications set forth on Schedule A (Products). It is anticipated that this work will include modifications to the embedded software and/or the keypad and/or the interface. Supplier and Purchaser shall collaborate to ensure the proper interface, connection and interoperability between the software of Supplier's product and that of the VetScan, a product of Purchaser. Technical specifications of the interfaces of Supplier's products and their modifications according to Purchaser's requirements for the Page 4 Products are set forth on Schedule D (Interface). Purchaser agrees to assist Supplier in the translations, revisions and editing work to provide an operating manual in English for the Products. 3.2 Reagents for Products. Purchaser shall be responsible for producing or procuring from third parties reagents for use in the Products. Supplier shall assist Purchaser in the procurement of reagents as well as inform Purchaser in writing of any changes in the performance of the Products that affect the specifications of the thencurrent reagent used on the Products with at least ninety (90) days prior notice. 3.3 Product Changes. Except with respect to Products ordered pursuant to a purchase order which has been accepted by Supplier as described in Section 2.1 (Orders) Supplier shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to make substitutions and modifications to the Products (including software improvements); provided, however, that Supplier agrees to consider that Purchaser's use of the Products is in the veterinary market in making any such substitutions or modifications. In the event that any proposed substitution or modification affects, in Supplier's reasonable judgment, the form, fit or function of a Product, Supplier shall give Purchaser written notice of such proposed substitution or modification at least thirty (30) days prior to its taking effect and Purchaser shall have the right, during such thirty (30)day period, to order Products without such substitution or modification for delivery within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such thirty (30)day period. Any changes that affect the Product performance, operation or documentation shall be provided to the Purchaser in writing with no less than ninety (90) days notice. Purchaser shall have the right, at any time and from time to time to request substitution and/or modification to the Products. In the event of such request Supplier agrees to review and consider the requested modifications and notify Purchaser whether it is feasible and/or practical to make the modifications requested. In the event Supplier notifies Purchaser the modifications are feasible and practical, it will also notify Purchaser of the estimated modification costs and estimated time for manufacturing the modified Product. All work requested by Purchaser, other than that set forth in Sections 3.1 (Customizations for the Veterinary Market), 6 (Warranty and Repairs) and 8.1 (Clinical Studies), will be charged on a time and materials basis, at an initial rate of fifty Euros ((euro)50) per employee per hour, for a minimum of 3.5 hours for each request (or as may be otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties). 3.4 Discontinued Products. Supplier agrees to notify Purchaser in writing not less than one (1) year in advance of the discontinuance of any Product. In the event Supplier is unable to manufacture the Products for Purchaser (due to bankruptcy, fire, or other event of force majeure), then Purchaser will have the right to manufacture the Products (or have the Products manufactured for Purchaser), and, in exchange, pay a reasonable royalty or license fee for such right. The parties will establish an escrow account providing for the deposit of updated copies of all information reasonably necessary for the manufacture of the Products with a third party (to be agreed upon by the parties) under terms to be agreed upon in good faith between the parties and such third party. Purchaser agrees to cover the costs for establishing and maintaining of said escrow account.

Purchaser shall retain and shall not alter or obscure any notices, markings or other insignia which are affixed to the Programs, related documentation or any part thereof.

Such party (i) has the corporate power and authority and the legal right to enter into the Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) has taken all necessary corporate action on its part required to authorize the execution and delivery of the Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder. The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party, and constitutes a legal, valid, binding obligation of such party and is enforceable against it in accordance with its terms subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application affecting the enforcement of creditor rights and judicial principles affecting the availability of specific performance and general principles of equity whether enforceability is considered a proceeding at law or equity. 11.2 Absence of Litigation. Supplier is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation (and has not received any communication) which alleges that the Products infringe upon any intellectual property rights of a third party. 11.3 Consents. All necessary consents, approvals and authorizations of all governmental authorities and other persons or entities required to be obtained by such party in connection with the Agreement have been obtained. 11.4 Intellectual Property. To the best of Supplier's knowledge, Supplier has sufficient legal and/or beneficial title and ownership under Supplier's intellectual property rights or sufficient license rights necessary for Supplier to fulfill Supplier's obligations under this Agreement and that Supplier is not aware of any communication alleging that Supplier has infringed the intellectual property rights of any third party. In the event that Supplier becomes aware that a Product may infringe a patent of a third party, Supplier agrees to disclose such patent to Purchaser. Supplier further agrees (i) to inquire of the applicable third party as to whether a license under such patent is available, and if so, (ii) to negotiate, in good faith, a license under such patent which would permit Purchaser to distribute the applicable Product as contemplated hereunder. If Supplier does not negotiate such a license in good faith and Page 11 Purchaser in good faith believes, from a business perspective, that a license under such patent is appropriate, Supplier agrees that Purchaser may contact the applicable third party in order to negotiate a license under such patent and Supplier agrees to reimburse Purchaser for any monies paid by Purchaser to the applicable third party under such patent license. As used herein, "intellectual property rights" means all patent rights, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret rights, and knowhow rights necessary or useful to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold, import and export the Products. 12. Indemnities. 12.1 By Supplier. Supplier shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any damages, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and court costs) as a result of or arising out of any claim (a) that the Products supplied hereunder infringe any patent or valid copyright of a third party; or (b) the Products supplied hereunder have caused bodily injury or property damage provided that (i) Purchaser shall have promptly provided Supplier written notice of such claim and reasonable cooperation, information and assistance in connection therewith and (ii) Supplier shall have sole control and authority with respect to the defense, settlement, or compromise thereof. Should any Product delivered hereunder become or, in Supplier's opinion be likely to become, the subject of such a claim under subsection (a), above, Supplier may, at its option, either procure for Purchaser the right to continue purchasing and using such Products, or replace or modify such Products so that they become noninfringing.
