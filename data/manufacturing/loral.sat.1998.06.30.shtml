The elements of the transfer orbit attained by the Launch Vehicle and Launch Vehicle orientation at the time of separation of the Satellite from the Launch Vehicle are within the 3sigma limits of the Launch Vehicle performance established by the Contractor. 15.2 Unsuccessful Injection. If the transfer orbit attained by the Launch Vehicle or Launch Vehicle orientation at the time of separation of the Satellite from the Launch Vehicle are outside the 3sigma limits, the Satellite injection shall be considered unsuccessful. However, the Contractor shall use its best efforts to utilize the propulsion capabilities of the Satellite to achieve a successful final orbit. Notwithstanding achievement of a successful final orbit, this situation shall be treated as an "Unsuccessful Injection."
