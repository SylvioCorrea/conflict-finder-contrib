SUPPLY AGREEMENT 8.1 3M may exercise any right or fulfill any obligation in this Article 8 itself or may procure an Affiliate to exercise such right or fulfill such obligation. 8.2 If SEPRACOR decides to market Licensed Product in any country or countries of SEPRACOR's choice, no later than the initiation of Phase III clinical studies SEPRACOR shall give prompt written notice to 3M following which the Parties shall, negotiate in good faith an exclusive Manufacture and Supply Agreement consistent with all relevant licensing and commercial supply terms contained in this Agreement and including reasonable annual minimum purchase requirements to be agreed upon no later than the NDA filing. 8.3 The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith a volume based supply price, to include minimums, for Licensed Product worldwide. The supply price of Licensed Product to SEPR.ACOR shall be a combination of unit price and royalty. Unit price of product will be no greater than $[**] per unit for the first [**] million units annually, and $[**] per unit for those units in excess of [**] million units annually. The royalty for the license granted under Section 9.3 shall be [**] percent ([**]%) of SEPRACOR's Net Sales Price (such royalty to be [**] when and in such countries where there are no issued or granted 3M Patent Rights). A supply price for sample Licensed Product will be negotiated by the Parties in the Supply Agreement. The following factors have been assumed for purposes of determining the above supply price: [**] actuation product SEPRACOR provides Levalbuterol tartrate at no cost 3M purchase actuator, aluminum can, valve, propellant and other formulation components and finished packaging material 3M's [**] manufacturing process is typical of other 3M manufactured products. 3M's testing of raw materials and finished product is typical of other 3M manufactured products. The above unit prices may be adjusted at any time prior to launch and thereafter annually and proportionally for any increase in 3M's Full Factory Cost (defined as 3M's costs for overhead, labor, raw material, and/or component costs directly allocable to the manufacture, labeling and/or packaging of Licensed Product and the cost of services supplied to 3M by third parties which are directly allocable to the manufacture, labeling 9 and/or packaging of Licensed Product) including such amount as is necessary to allow 3M to maintain its factory cost ratio of Licensed Product. Such increase shall normally be no greater than PPI +1% from the prior calendar year. In the event of an extraordinary increase in price due to such factors as a shortage of raw material or change in product specifications or manufacturing mandated by regulatory authorities, 3M may increase the supply price for Licensed Product at the time it incurs such increase. In addition, 3M reserves the right prior to commencement of the Manufacture and Supply Agreement to increase the maximum price quoted herein for any change in the assumptions stated above or any increase in the cost of manufacturing Licensed Product due to an increase in the cost of acquiring SEPRACOR Components above the cost on the Effective date including any additional cost necessary to maintain 3M's factory cost ratio. 8.4 3M shall exclusively supply, using reasonable commercial efforts to do so, Licensed Product to SEPRACOR, Affiliates, and permitted sublicensees only and 3M shall not supply Product (not limited to Licensed Product) to any third party. Except as provided in Section 8.5 below, 3M shall have the exclusive right and license to supply SEPRACOR, its Affiliates and permitted sublicensee' s requirements of Licensed Product, and SEPRACOR, Affiliates, and permitted sublicensees shall not purchase Product (not limited to Licensed Product) other than from 3M, during the term of this Agreement. 8.5 Anything else in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, SEPRACOR shall have the limited contractual right to procure Licensed Product for use in clinical trials only from a third party for such time as 3M is unable to provide SEPRACOR with such supply, provided, however, that (i) SEPRACOR shall diligently pursue obtaining regulatory approval for Licensed Product manufactured by 3M, (ii) neither SEPRACOR nor the third party supplier shall have any right to use any 3M KnowHow in the manufacture of such Licensed Product, and (iii) from and after the time that 3M is able to supply Licensed Product pursuant to this Agreement or the Supply Agreement, 3M shall have the exclusive right and license to supply SEPRACOR, its Affiliates, and permitted sublicensee's requirements of Licensed Product during the term of this Agreement and any future Supply Agreement. 9.

The plan is designed to develop a process that supplies nominal [**]dose product per US requirements. The plan assumes that the optimization runs will meet required process/product acceptance criteria for a US product. Only 1 container/closure system is to be developed for the product assuming use of Sepracor components. [**]. The dates stated are all estimates. However, the earliest commercialization date is a primary objective goal of both companies. The project is taken to the point that 3M provides the [**] manufacturing process, DMF references and stability data portions of the NDA. The cost estimates exclude additional time for 3M review and comments on the NDA package, responses to FDA and responding to NDA deficiencies. No critical issues develop during the course of the project. OUS clinical supplies will not be needed from the registration batches. Process validation will not be performed until commercialization batches. NDA submission will occur after completion of the Sepracor generated stability report covering the testing interval identified as required to support the NDA submission. The NDA submission date will not necessarily be contingent upon the availability of 12 months stability data. The NDA will be amended with additional stability data as available. Product costs are in addition to development costs. LAB PROCESS INVESTIGATIONS The Sepracor data package contains sufficient information on crimp optimization to minimize 3M's investigation time. Sepracor will perform pharmaceutical performance testing on lab scale samples to confirm equivalent product performance to the current process prior to full scale batch manufacture. Appropriate clean testing studies and methods currently exist. PROCESS OPTIMIZATION At least [**] lots (preferably more) of all raw materials provided by Sepracor ([**]) are available to manufacture all [**] initial batches of product. The manufacturing dates are not yet reserved. Availability of the production facility will be based on the production schedule at the time the development agreement is finalized. Delays in the plan may occur if manufacturing conflicts are found. Page 1 of 3 Confidential SEPRACOR XOPENEX(R) HFA MDI PROCESS SCALEUP PROJECT December 12, 2001 For initial process optimization purposes, [**] batches will be run at full scale capacity ([**] units) with [**] at the edge of process tolerances (high and low) and [**] at the nominal setpoints. Inprocess testing will be performed on the [**] nominal process batch prior to manufacture of the [**] batches at nominal settings. The optimization batches will be filled in the following sequence: [**]. The plan assumes that the first [**] lots of product manufactured at the nominal process settings meet specifications. If the [**] batches are found to be acceptable, they will be utilized for NDA clinical trials and NDA stability testing. If the [**] batches at nominal process settings are placed on NDA stability then batches #[**] and [**] will only be manufactured to provide information for the process performance requirements for the CMC section of the NDA. Batches [**] and [**] are not to be placed on NDA stability. This places a higher risk on the stability performance of the first [**] batches. If the optimization runs are not successful in meeting acceptable product/process criteria, additional optimizations will be required. Process maintenance runs are only listed through 2005, but will be necessary on an annual basis until approval of the product. REGISTRATION STABILITY/CLINICAL SUPPLIES Stability testing will be performed on nominal [**]dose product only to US requirements. Additional raw material or finished product testing for OUS markets is not included in this plan. 3M will perform pivotal stability, according to a piedefined protocoL Responsibility for the testing of these samples will be shared between 3M and Sepracor until analytical methods have been fully transferred to 3M. Samples will be stored in stability ovens at both 3M and Sepracor during this period. All stability protocols will be developed jointly by both Sepracor and 3M prior to study initiation. 3M DDS will be responsible for developing all manufacturing protocols which will be subject to Sepracor QA review. All summary reports will he jointly reviewed by both Sepracor and 3M DDS. No lot will be placed into a clinical study until full review of the resulting batch clearance testing and protocol sample testing and agreement between Sepracor and 3M Drug Delivery. Testing, review and approval of data should be targeted for completion within [**] weeks from availability of samples. Release of the [**] batches at the nominal process settings for use in clinical studies is to be contingent on review and consideration of the test data from the [**] optimization batches at the extreme process conditions. For interim stability testing intervals, Sepracor will accept and 3M may provide QA data sheets within [**] weeks of the testing interval per agreed upon format. Page 2 of 3 SEPRACOR XOPENEX(R) HFA MDI PROCESS SCALEUP PROJECT December 12, 2001 + Method crossovers will initially be between Sepracor and 3M St. Paul. Analysts from St. Paul will perform the inprocess testing for the optimization batches. Method crossovers between 3M St. Paul and the Northridge QC lab have been added as a separate set of tasks and will occur at a later date to expedite method training and crossovers. DEVELOPMENT COSTS The following cost estimates assume full stability testing by 3M. Depending on the timing of analytical method transfer from Sepracor to 3M, the actual 3M Development Costs may be lower. &lt;Table&gt; &lt;Caption&gt; 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 &lt;S&gt; &lt;C&gt; &lt;C&gt; &lt;C&gt; &lt;C&gt; &lt;C&gt; &lt;C&gt; @ $[**]/hour $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] Incremental increase for [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] hours charged at $[**]/hour (Section 7.2) not reflected in subsequent Cost Summary document Total $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ [**] $ 2,800 &lt;/Table&gt; PRODUCT COSTS + [**] batches at full scale ([**] units/each) = [**] units. This does not include process maintenance lots (estimated at [**] per year until product approval). Page 3 of 3 Schedule 6.4 Pricing of Product for Clinical Supplies Pricing of Product will be $[**] per unit based on theoretical batch size. Pricing assumes: SEPRACOR provides Compound. SEPRACOR Components are canister, valve, actuator. 3M provides Samples to SEPRACOR in a bulk packaged unlabelled format. Batch size minimums are defined by 3M process.
