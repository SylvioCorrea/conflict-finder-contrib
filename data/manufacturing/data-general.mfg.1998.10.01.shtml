In addition, this Agreement shall also apply to any other Replacements and Repair and Refurbishment services, provided that DGC's purchase order includes the following legend: "This Purchase Order is placed under Volume Pricing Agreement No. 2085 dated October 1, 1998, which shall exclusively govern this Purchase Order." 1.5 DGC estimates that it will purchase an average quarterly quantity of units of MATERIAL as listed on Attachment A of this Agreement during the term of this Agreement. However, [*]. If the purchases for the previous two (2) quarters fall below [*] percent of the average quarterly quantity mentioned in this paragraph 1.5 and detailed in Attachment A, upon which initial pricing is herein based, BCS has the right to adjust prices on subsequent orders placed by DGC upon written notice to DGC. BCS will allow DGC [*] days to place sufficient noncancelable orders to bring the actual quantities purchased in line with the forecast herein stated. If DGC's actual purchases of MATERIAL are [*] or more above the original forecast, DGC can request pricing be adjusted on subsequent new orders. 1.6 Any DGC divisions, plants, and companies controlled by, controlling or under common control with DGC (being DGC's "Affiliated Companies") may purchase MATERIAL, Replacements and Repair and Refurbishment services, all as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 2.

Unless otherwise agreed, invoices shall not issue until delivery of the MATERIAL at the F.O.B. Point. 2.3 BCS agrees that the [*] will be [*] than the [*] by BCS to any of its customers [*] products in [*] upon [*]. In the event that BCS offers [*] or other [*] to other customers for [*] in [*] upon [*] during the term of this Agreement, then BCS shall [*] similar [*] in [*] and [*] to DGC. DGC and BCS will meet quarterly to review pricing and, if mutually agreed in a signed writing, implement price adjustments based on the current market conditions and other related factors. The revised pricing, if any, will only apply to MATERIAL purchased from the review date forward, or upon a date agreed to in writing by both parties, and be in effect until the next pricing review or other pricing action. Upon DGC receipt of any amended pricing schedule or other document reflecting BCS's adjustments in price, pricing hereunder shall be deemed amended by substitution of such amended pricing schedule / document. 2.4 DGC acknowledges that MATERIAL, including documentation and other technical data, are subject * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. Page 3 of 45 4 VOLUME PRICING AGREEMENT 2085 to export controls imposed by the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and the laws of other countries worldwide (the "Export Laws"). DGC warrants and represents to BCS that it will not export or reexport (directly or indirectly) any MATERIAL, or documentation or other technical data therefor, in whole or in part, in violation of the Export Laws and the regulations thereunder. DGC, at its costs, shall obtain all necessary export documentation, licenses and authorizations for international shipments, and BCS agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist DGC in such effort. 3. LEAD TIME; DELIVERY DEFINITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Timeliness of delivery of MATERIAL pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement is of the essence. BCS will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause MATERIAL to be delivered to DGC's designated "ShipTo" location no later than the "Date Due" specified on the purchase order(s) submitted pursuant to Section 1.4 above, provided that DGC allows no less that the lead time(s) stated in Attachment A (for MATERIAL) and Attachment D (for Replacements). For such purpose, lead time shall mean the time between BCS's receipt of DGC's order and the "Date(s) Due" specified for such order. BCS shall not deliver MATERIAL more than four (4) days before the specified "Date Due". BCS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate and accept orders allowing less than the required lead time. BCS will provide written acknowledgement of committed delivery dates for all DGC orders within 5 business days after BCS's receipt of DGC's order. 3.2 By the tenth (10th) business day of each month, DGC shall provide BCS with a written rolling 26week forecast of its anticipated MATERIAL requirements. 3.3 Except as provided in Section 4.2, orders not delivered in a timely manner (as described in Section 3.1) shall be subject to rescheduling, at DGC's option and without charge, and without limitation of DGC's other remedies. 3.4 In the event that BCS determines that it may be unable to make timely delivery of MATERIAL not later than the committed delivery dates, then BCS shall promptly: (1) make commercially reasonable efforts (e.g., use of overtime, expedited procurement of parts and components, and expedited shipment (such as use of air freight)) to minimize the delay, and (2) inform DGC of the situation, the actions so taken and to be taken by BCS, and when BCS expects to be able to effect delivery. BCS is responsible for all incremental costs arising from actions taken to minimize late deliveries, including without limitation any incremental freight charges associated with expedited shipments. 3.5 Except as expressly otherwise stated herein, and subject to each term and condition of this Agreement, BCS will supply the MATERIAL described in Attachment A throughout the stated term of this Agreement. BCS shall provide [*] days' written notice of intent to discontinue the manufacture, sale or distribution of any or all MATERIAL ("End of Life" or "EOL"). DGC may place orders for any demand during the [*] days of such notice for delivery of affected MATERIAL prior to the end of the notice period. To the extent that such orders exceed DGC's previous forecast in Section 3.2 for MATERIAL, the orders shall be noncancelable. Unless BCS agrees in writing to the contrary, BCS shall accept only forecasted orders in the last [*] days of the stated notice period, and such orders shall be (i) for delivery within four (4) months after the date such orders are placed, and (ii) noncancelable. * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

[*] days or greater before Unlimited rescheduling permitted provided Date Due that the MATERIAL is not identified in Attachment A as DGC UNIQUE MATERIAL 4.2 Rescheduling: Accelerated or LessThanLeadtime Deliveries BCS shall accommodate DGC's requests to accelerate the date(s) of deliveries and/or to manufacture and deliver MATERIAL (specifically excluding GBICs which are not integrated into SWITCHES) in a shorter period than the applicable lead time, as follows: ACCELERATION SCHEDULE NOTICE PERIOD CONDITIONS 0 30 days before Date Due BCS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy DGC's requirements [*] days before Date Due BCS shall accommodate DGC's requirements, insofar as not exceeding [*] above Monthly Forecasted Demand [*] days before Date Due BCS shall accommodate DGC's requirements, insofar as not exceeding [*] above Monthly Forecasted Demand [*] days or greater before BCS shall accommodate DGC's requirements, Date Due, or prior to BCS's insofar as not exceeding [*] above Monthly leadtime, whichever is Forecasted Demand. Further, BCS shall use earlier its commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate any requested increase/ acceleration above that level. For these purposes, "Monthly Forecasted Demand" shall mean the average of the last [*] months actual shipment quantities and the forecast for the next 4 months, which forecast has been submitted to BCS pursuant to Section 3.2 above no less than 30 days prior to the date of the request for acceleration. The parties agree that DGC shall not have the remedies set forth in Section 3.3 above on account of BCS's failure to meet DGC's accelerated Due Dates. * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. Page 5 of 45 6 VOLUME PRICING AGREEMENT 2085 4.3 Cancellation DGC may cancel any order, by notice given not later than delivery of the MATERIAL to the F.O.B. Point. There shall be no cancellation charges for orders canceled with a notice period greater than the specified lead time for the MATERIAL being canceled, nor for cancellation of any MATERIAL described below which is canceled with at least the belowspecified notice: CANCELLATION SCHEDULE NOTICE PERIOD CANCELLATION CHARGES 030 days before Date Due 100% of the Purchase Price 3189 days before Date Due [*] of the Purchase Price 90 days or greater before Date No liability for cancellation Due, or prior to the specified leadtime, whichever is earlier All other cancellations may be subject to cancellation charges to be negotiated between the parties, which shall not exceed the lesser of (i) BCS's direct damages, or (ii) [*]. Without limitation, if cancelled MATERIAL is not customized for, or a proprietary product of, DGC, then if BCS can find an alternate customer to purchase cancelled MATERIAL within three (3) months after the date upon which DGC would have been obliged to take delivery of such MATERIAL, BCS agrees that its restocking charges, if asserted, will not exceed [*] of the Purchase Price. 4.4 Change of Destination By written notice given not later than [*] days before shipment of MATERIAL, DGC may change the "shipto" destination designated in DGC's orders. Nondomestic shipments shall require 30 days written notice of such change. 5. WARRANTIES 5.1 BCS agrees that the warranty extended to DGC herein for the MATERIAL is the same or better than that extended by BCS to any of its customers purchasing comparable products (the "Standard Warranty"). In the event that BCS offers more favorable standard warranty terms (e.g., extended length of the warranty granted over standard BCS products) to other customers purchasing comparable products during the term of this Agreement, then BCS shall immediately extend similar terms to DGC and its Affiliated Companies for MATERIAL ordered after the date upon which such more favorable terms are granted. 5.2 All MATERIAL shall be new (except repaired or refurbished MATERIAL provided to DGC under warranty service by BCS) and, in the case of Hardware, in compliance with DGC's specifications as referenced in Attachment B and, to the extent not inconsistent, BCS's specifications, and in the case of Software, in substantial compliance with DGC's specifications as referenced in Attachment B and, to the extent not inconsistent, BCS's specifications. From time to time, BCS may issue notice of "Mandatory Field Changes", which are changes to MATERIAL required to satisfy governmental environmental, safety or other standards, reliability concerns, or to guarantee a continuity of supply. BCS will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide DGC with [*] days' prior written notice of Mandatory Field Changes prior to implementing such changes; however this period may be * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. Page 6 of 45 7 VOLUME PRICING AGREEMENT 2085 reduced if the change involves safety or reliability, or if otherwise required by law. BCS shall issue Mandatory Field Change Orders ("MFCOs") to effect such changes. The parties shall mutually agree on how DGC shall implement the MFCOs. MFCOs shall include all documentation necessary to properly define and implement any such change, and BCS shall at its expense deliver to DGC kits of all parts and materials necessary to effect MFCOs on all MATERIAL previously delivered as soon as practical under the circumstances. BCS will reimburse DGC's actual and reasonable costs incurred in implementing such MFCOs. 5.3 All Hardware shall be free from defects during the "Standard Warranty" stated in Attachment A, and all Software shall be materially free of defects during the Standard Warranty for Software stated in Attachment A. BCS agrees to repair or replace all defective Hardware and Software (as verified by BCS in its sole reasonable discretion) which is returned to BCS during the Standard Warranty, and to return such Hardware or Software to DGC within the "Warranty Cycle Time for MATERIAL" stated in Attachment A or as specified under DGC's "Advanced Exchange" terms stated below. In the event that Hardware or Software returned is not defective, DGC will be responsible for freight costs for return shipment to DGC. Defective Hardware or Software which is not repaired or replaced, and returned, within the stated period shall be subject to revocation of acceptance, whereupon BCS shall refund to DGC the thencurrent purchase price (less any previous credits, refunds or discounts) for such Hardware and Software. DGC shall comply with BCS's reasonable Return Material Authorization ("RMA") procedures when making returns under this Agreement; BCS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide RMAs to DGC (or DGC's designated contractors) within [*] of request. DGC shall be responsible for all charges arising from return of warranty claims to BCS and BCS shall be responsible for payment of all shipping charges relative to return of warranty claims to DGC. 5.4 "Advanced Exchange" BCS agrees to support DGC's "Advanced Exchange" requirements by delivering replacement MATERIAL prior to receipt of defective MATERIAL from DGC. The parties acknowledge that such Advance Exchange requests shall generally take between [*] and [*] calendar days. 5.4.1 Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon written request from DGC for "Expedited NextDay Advanced Exchange", BCS will provide next business day shipment of replacement MATERIAL for MATERIAL listed on Attachment A of this Agreement that is covered by BCS's Standard Warranty to any DGC designated U.S. or Canadian location (excepting only requests made on weekends and holidays, which shall be delivered on the second business day) for a [*] per incident charge, unless the necessity for exercising Expedited NextDay Advanced Exchange is attributable to delinquencies in the delivery of MATERIAL or spare Field Replaceable Units ("FRUs"), or of (normal) Advanced Exchange MATERIAL replacements, or of MATERIAL serviced under BCS's warranty, to DGC by BCS. 5.5 BCS agrees to maintain an adequate inventory of replacement MATERIAL for DGC to cover the estimated or actual annual replacement MATERIAL rate, as stated in Attachment C of this Agreement. 5.6 Regardless of whether or not DGC avails itself of the Expedited NextDay Advance Exchange mechanism described in Section 5.4.1, DGC will be required to return all defective MATERIAL to BCS no later than fifteen (15) days after the replacement MATERIAL has been received by DGC. If the defective MATERIAL are not returned by DGC within thirty (30) days after receipt of the replacement MATERIAL, BCS will invoice DGC at the thencurrent purchase price, with payment due no later than [*] days after receipt of the invoice from BCS. * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

Page 7 of 45 8 VOLUME PRICING AGREEMENT 2085 5.7 DeadonArrival ("DOA") MATERIAL and Catastrophic Failures of MATERIAL 5.7.1 Dead on Arrival: Insofar as requested by DGC in writing to meet its business requirements, BCS agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide expedited assistance and replacement of MATERIAL found to be defective upon initial inspection or use at DGC, in no event longer than [*] days after receipt by BCS of the returned DOA MATERIAL. 5.7.2 "Catastrophic failures" are defined as MATERIAL demonstrating failure rates materially in excess of [*] times those predicted by the applicable specifications (under defectpermillion, meantimebetweenfailure and any other applicable parameters). BCS also agrees that if a repair, recall or replacement is required, then BCS will make commercially reasonable efforts and at its sole discretion to: (A) provide sufficient replacement MATERIAL no later than [*] days after repair, recall or replacement is initiated to retrofit DGC's installed base, (B) repair, replace or accept for credit all affected MATERIAL in a jointly agreeable manner, (C) reimburse DGC for all actual and [*] to retrofit DGC's installed base, and (D) upon request, provide appropriate technical and business support at DGC and DGC's customer sites. BCS will reimburse DGC for all freight and freight related charges arising in connection with verified catastrophic warranty claims on such MATERIAL. 5.8 Mutual Warranties. Each party certifies and represents to the other party that as of the Effective Date, it has full power, right and authority to execute this Agreement, to fulfill all its rights and obligations herein. 5.9 Restrictions. The foregoing Standard Warranty shall not apply to MATERIAL that have been (i) damaged by accident, Acts of God, shipment, improper installation, abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse or misapplication, as determined by BCS in its sole reasonable discretion, or (ii) modified without BCS's express written authorization. 5.10 GBICs. BCS warrants that the GBICs are new, and that the GBICs will conform to the specifications established by the manufacturer of the GBICs. Except as set forth herein, BCS makes no warranties of any kind with respect to the performance of the GBICs that BCS may use in the manufacture of MATERIAL. As a remedy for defective GBICs, BCS will provide replacement parts as a service to DGC for verified GBICs failures that occur within twelve (12) months of the date of shipment to DGC, as set forth in Attachment A. Such replacements will be administered in the same manner as warranty claims concerning Switches (e.g., RMA process, Advanced Exchange capability, Warranty Cycle Time, etc.). 5.11 Exclusive Remedy. DGC acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the Standard Warranty is as set forth in this Section 5. 5.12 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS STATED IN SECTION 7, THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF, AND BCS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 5.13 Indemnification by DGC. DGC agrees to defend, indemnify and hold BCS harmless from any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of litigation) incurred by BCS as a result of any third party claim, regardless of the form of action, arising from a modification: (i) to MATERIAL made by BCS at the request of DGC for MATERIAL sold by BCS to DGC or any DGCaffiliated entity entitled to purchase MATERIAL * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. Page 8 of 45 9 VOLUME PRICING AGREEMENT 2085 hereunder pursuant to Section 1.2 above, which claim would not have arisen but for the modification requested, or (ii) by DGC of the Documentation (as defined herein); provided that BCS promptly notifies DGC of any such claim in writing, gives DGC sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, and cooperates with DGC in defending or settling any such claim. 6. QUALITY 6.1 It is BCS's intention and commitment to deliver Hardware and GBICs to DGC which is free of defects and Software which is materially free of defects. To that end, BCS will take those actions and make those reports to DGC as described in Attachment C ("Quality Requirements"). BCS shall establish and maintain a documented quality system as a means to ensure that all Hardware and GBICs processes and operations conform, and all Software processes and operations substantially conform, to the applicable specifications of this Agreement. 6.2 Product Changes/Concerns in MATERIAL Manufactured by or for BCS (Specifically Excluding GBICs) BCS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide DGC with [*] days' notice of changes to MATERIAL (specifically excluding GBICs) that affect the form, fit or function of such MATERIAL ("Engineering Change Order" or "ECO"). The ECO shall contain the reason for the change and test data to support the change. If requested, BCS shall concurrently make samples available for evaluation. BCS shall also notify DGC promptly should a concern arise regarding the quality of MATERIAL already delivered, e.g., any condition which might impact substantial compliance with specification, reliability, or safety, or increase the rate of defects. If DGC does not respond to BCS in writing with respect to an ECO within fifteen (15) business days following receipt of such ECO, the ECO will be deemed accepted by DGC. In the event that DGC objects in writing to an ECO in the stated time period, then DGC may provide BCS with written notice of such objection, and shall be entitled to (in addition to placing orders for the changed MATERIAL) submit purchase orders for the unchanged MATERIAL prior to the effective date of the implementation of the ECO, for delivery no more than ninety (90) days after the effective date of such implementation and in quantities which do not exceed the total quantity of such MATERIAL ordered by DGC in the six (6) months immediately preceding the date of notice of ECO. 6.3 Required Quality Levels for Hardware Without limitation, the parties shall evaluate quality by using Defect Per Million (DPM) statistics and other pertinent methods. BCS warrants that the aggregate DPM of the Hardware shall meet or exceed the threshold(s) stated in Attachment C. BCS agrees to seek to make continuous improvement in DPM statistics during each succeeding years of the term. 6.4 NonConforming MATERIAL DGC reserves the right to reject MATERIAL which in its reasonable determination does not conform to the specifications as referenced in Attachment B. DGC reserves the right to defer inspection until time of actual use of MATERIAL by DGC or the end user, as the case may be, but not longer than [*] days from shipment. Returns of rejected MATERIAL shall be by BCS's standard RMA procedure, with DGC shipping the MATERIAL prepaid to BCS's U.S. repair facility and BCS shipping prepaid return to DGC's U.S. warehouse. 6.5 Corrective Actions: Performance Review In the event BCS is unable to maintain the quality levels required herein, BCS will promptly initiate corrective action pursuant to the terms and conditions of Attachment F (Service and Support Requirements). A permanent process modification and root cause analysis will be made available within thirty (30) days or such other reasonable timeframe that is mutually agreed upon. Results of the failure or root cause analysis shall be provided to DGC in a written report detailing the results of the investigation and corrective actions plans to prevent its * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. Page 9 of 45 10 VOLUME PRICING AGREEMENT 2085 recurrence. DGC agrees to limit requests for failure or root analysis in situations where the results would be important to DGC's business or DGC's customer satisfaction. DGC and BCS shall meet on a quarterly basis to review BCS's performance. 6.6 SEE ARTICLE 8.3 and ATTACHMENT F 7. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 7.1 Intellectual Property Rights Infringement Indemnification. 7.1.1 Hardware and Software. BCS warrants that no part of the MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) infringes any patent established under any of the [*] or any copyright or other proprietary right of any third party. BCS shall defend at its expense all claims, and pay all awards and damages, based on any claim that the MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) or its sale or use infringes any patent established under any of the [*] or any copyright or other proprietary right of any third party, provided that DGC promptly notifies BCS of such claim, provides its full cooperation and grants BCS control of its defense. DGC shall have the right to be represented by its own counsel (at DGC's expense). If use of MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) is enjoined, BCS shall make commercially reasonable efforts at its expense either (i) to gain rights to make, use and sell the MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) as set forth herein, or (ii) to modify the MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) so that it becomes noninfringing while remaining in conformity in all material respects with specifications. Otherwise, at DGC's option, DGC may return the MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs), and BCS shall refund the [*] of MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) (less any previous credits, refunds or discounts) and accept its return. 7.1.2 GBICs. In the event that the GBICs are found to infringe the proprietary rights of any third party, BCS will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist DGC in procuring noninfringing GBICs from any manufacturer and/or vendor from which BCS procures GBICs. Further, BCS assigns to DGC its rights to pursue (as subrogated party) any rights and remedies BCS may have against the GBIC manufacturers and vendors from which BCS procures GBICs sold hereunder solely with respect to those GBICs sold to DGC by BCS hereunder. 7.2 Restrictions. BCS will not be obligated to defend or be liable for costs and damages to the extent that infringement, or a claim thereof, arises out of or is related to (a) a modification to MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) requested by DGC or made to MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) by DGC or a third party, (b) use or combination of MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) with products or data not provided by BCS if use of the MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) alone would not have so infringed and if such combination was not contemplated by BCS's written specifications or written product descriptions for the MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs), (c) use of other than the latest unmodified release of MATERIAL (specifically excluding the GBICs) made available to DGC by BCS if such infringement would have been avoided by the use thereof. 7.3 Limitations.

SERVICE AND SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS 1.0 Service and Support Requirement DGC will be responsible for working directly with the end users, and BCS Support will work directly with DGC to support DGC personnel, as set forth below. DGC represents and warrants that it is experienced in, capable of, and staffed to provide, Level 1 and Level 2 support (as defined below). BCS offers training programs to assist in attaining this level of expertise on MATERIAL. BCS will accept calls only from DGC level II engineers who have successfully completed courses 2 and 3 set forth below and/or who have undergone formal DGC training on MATERIAL. BCS will provide Level 3 support (as defined below). 2.0 Support Level Definitions 2.1 Level 1 Support: Level 1 support is the first line, direct end user contact, most likely via a telephone call handling group provided by DGC. Level One support includes: * First contact direct DGC/End User interaction * Information collection and analysis * Identification of whether the problem is known and has a known solution * Troubleshooting and problem reproduction * Problem report administration and tracking The parties agree that End Users shall not have the right to contact BCS directly for questions related to the Products. 2.2 Level 2 Support: Level 2 support is "technical support" provided by DGC personnel. Level 2 support is typically provided by experts in the applicable Product and who serve as the escalation point for Level 1. Level 2 support personnel are expected to resolve all known problems, installation and configuration issues, assist in firmware or driver updates at the End User site, search BCS posted Technical Notes and other technical information supplied that will assist in providing problem resolutions. All pertinent data shall be entered in DGC's problem tracking database. Should the Level 2 analyst be unable to resolve a problem, either because of lack of expertise, exhausted troubleshooting knowledge, or expiration of the allotted Level 2 resolution time, the Level 2 analyst may escalate the problem to Level 3 for resolution as set forth below. Level 2 personnel of DGC will continue to diligently work with Level 3 personnel of BCS to accomplish resolution. Level 2 personnel of DGC will communicate all resolutions back to the End Users. Escalations should be presented to BCS engineers in the form of a problem tracking data base record with all pertinent configuration detail and failure information or symptoms documented in detail. In an effort to maintain an efficient support organization and crisp exchange of information, DGC will limit the number of support personnel (Level 2) authorized to contact BCS (Level 3) to approximately 5 (or their designated alternates). Page 28 of 45 29 VOLUME PRICING AGREEMENT 2085 2.3 Level 3 Support: Level 3 support is provided by BCS System Engineers (SE) and/or Technical Support Engineers (TSE). Level 3 is the first point of contact for technical issues between BCS and DGC. Once the parties mutually agree that a problem should be escalated to Level 3, BCS will be responsible for resolution and will utilize commercially reasonable resources to resolve such problem. Prior to escalating to Level 3, it is expected that DGC shall provide the following information and documentation: * Any error information from the device connected to the switch and from the switch. * All names and revisions of hardware equipment. * All firmware revisions of the drivers. * Any log files from the devices connected to the switch. * Any trace file from the devices connected to the switch. * The configuration information of the equipment being used. * Detailed definition of all steps taken to reproduce and resolve this situation prior to escalation to Level 3. Assigned Level 3 support personnel (SE and/or TSE) can be contacted via direct dial, email to an established "support" alias, web site initiated input, and by calling BCS's 1888ATFIBRE support number. Direct access to BCS support personnel will be possible during normal BCS business hours (8 AM to 5 PM PST, MF). Emergency situations for Severity 1 problems are handled via 7 X 24 pager coverage at 1888ATFIBRE (18882834273) 3.0 BCS Severity Definitions and Support Goals The goal for initial response time to all telephone support requests is thirty (30) minutes or less during normal BCS working hours. For after hours telephone requests, the goal is one (1) hour or less. The targeted response time for requests submitted by other means, such as email, or fax, is four (4) hours. Severity Definition Service Objective Resolution Time 1 BCS Product is completely non Respond to initial request Less than 5 days, functional, or deemed a safety hazard, within 30 minutes during using commercially situation has high impact on normal BCS business hours, reasonable efforts development or delivery efforts. and 1 hour for nonbusiness Installation problems. hours.
