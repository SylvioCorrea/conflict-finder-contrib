The purpose of performing nonGMP demonstration runs at the "..." scale is to assess the reproducibility of the entire process prior to cGMP toxicology lot production at the "..." scale. Records for this stage of process will be kept in laboratory notebooks or standardized data sheets or draft batch records A limited number of analytical techniques to verify product identity and quality will be performed on material from those demonstration runs using prequalified assays and performed by the Process Development staff Specific goals for yield and purity will be mutually agreed upon between Sponsor and CBSI based on early development results, clinical needs and project timelines. Goals will be dependent on the properties of Product. The purpose of the cGMP toxicology lot production at the "..." scale is to produce "..." of cGMP material for "..." lots of "..." and "..." for animal toxicology and pharmacology studies. It is estimated that "..." runs will be needed to achieve this goal. A sufficient number of "..." runs will be pooled, following a prerelease3 of sublots, at the end of purification to provide the "..." lots.
