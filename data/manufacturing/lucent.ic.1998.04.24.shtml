LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES / CD RADIO RECEIVER INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AGREEMENT * THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between Lucent Technologies Inc., a Delaware corporation, acting through its Microelectronics Group, having an office at Two Oak Way, Berkeley Heights, New Jersey 07922 ("Lucent") and CD Radio, Inc., a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of business at 2175 K Street NW, Washington, DC, 20037 ("CD Radio"). The effective date of this Agreement is the later of the dates of execution by the respective parties, as set forth below herein. IN CONSIDERATION OF the mutual covenants set forth hereinbelow, the parties agree to the following terms and conditions: PART 1: BUSINESS TERMS 1. BACKGROUND This is an agreement between the Microelectronics Group of Lucent Technologies Inc. ("Lucent") and CD Radio Inc. ("CD Radio") to develop a systems engineering specification for the communications link of a Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service (S DARS), and a specification for a set of integrated circuits ("ICs") for such a receiver ("chip set"). Upon the mutual acceptance of the chip set specification by CD Radio and Lucent, Lucent would then fabricate and deliver a prototype of the proposed receiver to verify the communications link performance and thereafter design and manufacture first prototypes and then production chip sets. The foregoing development plan is based upon Lucent's current understanding of CD Radio's needs. It is Lucent's understanding that the objective of the project is to develop a chip set for a low cost, addressable satellite receiver for CD Radio's broadcasts. The details given herein are a baseline, with further details to evolve as the project proceeds. 2. THREE PROJECT PHASES The Lucent part of the project will be completed in three phases: 1. authorship and delivery of a systems engineering document and the development of a chip set specification; 2. fabrication and delivery of a prototype receiver using existing components from one or more integrated circuit ("IC") vendors; and * This agreement is subject to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portions have been omitted from this Form 10Q and have been replaced by asterisks (*). The confidential portions have been filed separately with the Commission as provided pursuant to Rule 24b2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 2 3. the design, layout, fabrication, and delivery of prototype ICs and, after approval by CD Radio, production devices for use in the consumer electronics original equipment manufacturer's ("CEOEM's") prototypes and production units. 1/ Lucent's IC development would facilitate the implementation by CD Radio of four potential products: (a) A radio including SDARS capability for installed car sound systems. The antenna unit would be hardwired to the rest of the receiver; (b) A "Plug 'n' Play" ("PnP") adapter for a subscriber's tape cassette car sound system; and (c) A PnP adapter for a subscriber's compact disk ("CD") car sound system. (d) * Bringing these products to market requires a division of labor between Lucent, CD Radio, and the CEOEM. This agreement gives the roles and responsibilities of each. In large measure, the chip sets for all four potential products are congruent and can be pursued in parallel. However, the products identified in subsections (b), (c) and (d) above require some extra effort in a few areas. 3. STATEMENT OF WORK 3.1 PHASE 1 SYSTEMS ENGINEERING The first task of Phase 1 shall be for Lucent and CD Radio to define and agree on an overall system level specification. The deliverables from the systems engineering phase are the communications link systems engineering document, chip set specification, a nonexclusive software license for a link simulator (runs slower than real time on a software platform such as SIMULINK), a link emulator (runs in real time on technical DSP hardware such as SPACE), and applicable documentation. 1/ There may be more than one CEOEM. For the sake of brevity, in this Agreement we will take CEOEM to mean "consumer electronics original equipment manufacturer(s)." 3 The documents, simulator, and emulator can be considered a prototype of a portion of the earth station transmitter. This will enable CD Radio's studio/earth station contractor to build a missioncritical version of the encoder that will connect both (a) digital audio feeds from the studios/content providers and b) receiver command and control output from CD Radio's customer center to c) the satellite uplink transmitter. Note that the Lucent systems engineering work will not cover satellite tracking, telemetry and control, nor the studios, nor the design and positioning of terrestrial repeaters, nor the generation of receiver commands for activation, billing, and deactivation of subscriber's accounts at CD Radio's customer center. At a minimum, the emulator will provide a baseband to baseband emulation. The extent to which actual RF uplink and space hardware can be incorporated into the emulator will depend on the level of cooperation provided by CD Radio's transmitter and satellite manufacturers. CD Radio shall test, review, and approve the work in Phase 1. After such review and approval, Lucent shall not be responsible in the case that the communications link does not meet CD Radio's need. Upon completion of Phase 1 Lucent will provide a quotation on chip set NRE and schedule and preliminary quotation of unit price. 3.2 PHASE 2 PROTOTYPE RECEIVER To verify the systems engineering concepts, a prototype receiver will be built. Lucent will obtain and assemble existing parts from one or more component vendors. The prototype receiver will enable early verification of the air interface specification and receiver design, but may contain parts that are higher in cost/power/size than the chip sets in a production receiver. Lucent will make the prototype receiver available to a CEOEM for engineering into a product at CD Radio's request. Making the prototype receiver into a product may require the CEOEM to modify the design to lower the implementation cost and/or size and/or power. In such a case, Lucent agrees to grant a royaltybearing, nonexclusive license, on commercially reasonable terms, to CD Radio and/or the CEOEM under any issued patent owned by Lucent (to the extent Lucent has a right to grant such license) which is infringed by such design. No further payment by CD Radio is necessary if such patent rights are already exhausted in the sale by Lucent to CD Radio and/or the CEOEM of a Lucent integrated circuit. Such a patent license will be limited to the specific field of use in which the Lucent integrated circuits are intended to be used, namely CD Radio's satellite digital audio broadcasting service and its associated terrestrial repeaters. Specifically, the license will forbid the use of such patents in the field of wholly terrestrial broadcasting. CD Radio and its CEOEM shall test, review, and approve the work in Phase 2. After such review and approval, Lucent shall not be responsible in the case that the communications link does not meet CD Radio's need. 4 After approval, the chip set design will proceed to Phase 3, as detailed below. 3.3 PHASES 1 AND 2 PAYMENT SCHEDULE Lucent will perform these two phases and charge CD Radio quarterly on a time and materials basis. * 3.4 IC DEVELOPMENT AND PROTOTYPE PRODUCTION The development work for Phase 3 will be performed by Lucent and charged to CD Radio quarterly on a time and materials basis. * 3.5 DESIGN HANDOFF REQUIREMENTS CD Radio shall review Phase 3 of the project at Design Inspection 1, Design Inspection 2, and Firmware Signoff meetings. Review and approval by CD Radio at these three points plus signature of the postlayout mask sign off sheet (including prototype IC acceptance criteria) shall constitute the Design HandOff Requirements mentioned below in Part 3 of this Agreement. 3.6 PRODUCTION IC PRICING Definitive production IC pricing is unknown at this time. However, Lucent believes it is commercially reasonable to achieve CD Radio's objective of not more than a $50 selling price per chip set, based on the information available today. At or before the completion of Phase 2, Lucent and CD Radio will establish a definitive pricing plan for commercially produced quantities of the chip set, based on the method outlined in Part 3, Section 12. Based on the outcome of this pricing plan, the period of exclusivity outlined in Section 6.0 will be determined. CD Radio intends to use the jointly owned chip specification to seek competitive bids on the chip set and to use any responses for the purposes of comparison with the price based on the method outlined in Part 3, Section 12. 4. ENGINEERING RISK 5 Lucent shall not be held liable by CD Radio or its subsidiaries, affiliates, OEM suppliers, subcontractors and customers, nor by any of their officers, shareholders, employees, representatives, agents, attorneys and any other such persons if the engineering objectives involved in this project are not met, so long as Lucent's engineering work has been performed in a professional manner in accordance with generally understood industry standards. 5. SCHEDULE A chip development project would normally commence after Phases 1 and 2 are complete, namely after Feb 28th, 1999. * In this case, given the need of CD Radio to meet its service launch date of Dec 1st, 1999, Lucent will attempt an accelerated schedule, where several methods are explored to make receivers available earlier than would normally be the case. The methods, to be explored in parallel, are: 1. Assess the practicality of the CEOEM making the receiver prototype developed in Phase 2 into a product for a Dec 1st, 1999 service launch. 2. Accelerate Phases 1 and 2 to complete them by Jun 15th 1998 and Jan 15th 1999, respectively. 3. Accelerate Phase 3 to 10 months from 15 months. 4. Commence some Phase 3 tasks in parallel with Phases 1 and 2. This shortens the part of the chip set development that occurs after completion of Phases 1 and 2. The part of Phase 3 that has to occur after Phases 1 and 2 is a minimum of 8 months. If all four methods are successful, CD Radio would have receivers based on the Phase 2 prototypes for its Dec 1st, 1999 service launch, and prototype ICs for a low cost Phase 3 receiver delivered to the CEOEM for system integration Sep 15th, 1999. However, no assurances can be given by Lucent that these methods will be successful in meeting these dates. 6. ONE WAY EXCLUSIVITY AND GUARANTEED MINIMUM PURCHASE CD Radio and its CEOEM shall make Lucent their exclusive supplier of CD Radio's SDARS receiver chip sets, for a limited period, as described below. 6 Nothing in this Agreement prevents Lucent from supplying the same or similar chips incorporating any of CD Radio's IPRs to any other of its present or future customers, including but not limited to CD Radio's competitor(s), so long as such customers have a license agreement with CD Radio and any applicable royalty is paid to CD Radio (as discussed under Intellectual Property below). Use of existing CD Radio IPR by Lucent in serving nonCD Radio customers in the SDARS application area is contingent on CD Radio deciding to license any such IPR as may be used in such ICs. Use of existing CD Radio IPR by Lucent in serving the designated CEOEM is hereby granted royalty free during the exclusivity period described below. Use of existing CD Radio IPR by Lucent in serving any CD Radio customers after the exclusivity period has ended is hereby granted royalty free. * CD Radio may cancel the exclusivity arrangement if Lucent fails to deliver to orders prototype ICs within fifteen (15) months from the date of the go ahead payment for Phase 3. Thereafter, CD Radio may cancel any exclusivity remaining if Lucent fails to deliver on orders a minimum of one (1) million production chip sets during the twelve (12) months following the start date, with a minimum of 75,000 in any given month. Thereafter, CD Radio may cancel any exclusivity remaining if Lucent fails to deliver on orders a minimum of 450,000 chip sets in any given month. Notwithstanding the above three (3) paragraphs, CD Radio shall not have the right to cancel the exclusivity arrangement if Lucent halts delivery due to nonpayment of Lucent invoices for previously delivered services or products relating to this project. Furthermore, the purchase orders shall be placed with due consideration for Lucent's fabrication logistics and manufacturing lead time as agreed prior to the commencement of Phase 3. If CD Radio or the CEOEM does not order and pay for a minimum of 1,000,000 delivered chip sets within the exclusivity period, CD Radio will compensate Lucent in the amount of $2,000,000 minus $2 per chip set actually ordered, delivered and paid for. 7. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon six (6) months written notice to the other party. Upon termination of this Agreement without cause, neither party shall be liable to the other, either for compensation or for damages of any kind or 7 character whatsoever, whether on account of the loss by Lucent or CD Radio of present or prospective profits on sales or anticipated sales, or expenditures, investments or commitments made in connection therewith, or on account of any other cause or thing whatsoever, except that termination shall not prejudice or otherwise affect the rights or liabilities of the parties with respect to any indebtedness then owing by either party to the other. 8. CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (CEOEM) CD Radio shall delegate to the CEOEM the following roles and responsibilities: o printed circuit board design; o specification, procurement and integration of: o discrete active components, such as transistors, diodes, varactors, light emitting diodes etc.; o passive components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, filters, crystal oscillators etc.; o keypad and display; o antennae; o commodity ICs such as memories, CD transmitter, FM transmitter, and power ICs; and o power supply and power supply management including any solar cells, batteries, battery management, capstan generators, smoothing and voltage regulation; o field testing in a variety of vehicles and under a variety of conditions; o mechanical engineering; o electromagnetic interference and compatibility, and shielding; o audio coupling to a tape head, or FM band transmitter, signal generator for input to a subscriber's CD car sound system; o making the product suitable for use by the majority of consumers, including: o user interface hardware and firmware; o ease of installation, set up and use; 8 o consumer information booklet; o microcontroller unit (MCU) and digital signal processor (DSP) firmware development and integration; o packaging, marketing and selling of receivers; and o handling of receivers returned by consumers, if any. o CD Radio shall oversee the CEOEM and monitor its performance. 9 PART 2: TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLYING TO PHASES ONE AND TWO PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT 1.

AGREEMENT This Agreement, effective as of the date of latest execution by a party hereto shown hereon, applies to one or more products (hereinafter "Device(s)") that are identified in Lucent's Business Terms to which these terms and conditions are attached and any additional Agreement that references this Agreement, (hereinafter "Agreement"). As used herein, "Agreement" refers to these terms and conditions and those parts of Part 1: Business Terms (the "Business Terms") that refer to Phase 3 of the project. This Agreement, together with the Business Terms, supersedes all prior oral or written understandings between the parties, and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, with respect to all transactions relating to the subject matter of the Business Terms. In the event of a conflict between the applicable Business Terms and these terms and conditions, the terms and conditions of the Business Terms shall prevail. Additional or differing terms appearing on any purchase order or other procurement document do not apply. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a writing signed by both parties. 2. CHANGE OF BUSINESS TERMS Proposed prices, fees and charges are valid only for the parameters or other particulars relating to the Device as stated in the Business Terms. If any changes in such parameters or particulars become necessary, including but not limited to revision or redefinition of the specification or variations in quantities, functional description, package type, or testing requirements, upon mutual agreement the parties may revise such prices by amendment to the Business Terms. Other proposed fees and charges are valid only for the respective particulars stated in the Business Terms. The parties may also amend the Business Terms with respect to any of such indicated fees and charges to make adjustments for changes in CD Radio's requirements. Any such amendments to the Business Terms shall reference the Business Terms and shall be further identified by their respective dates and shall be signed by both parties. 3. PROTOTYPE IC APPROVAL Within ninety (90) days after receipt of prototype ICs for any Device covered by this Agreement, CD Radio may return any claimed nonconforming prototype ICs to Lucent with a written rejection statement specifying the alleged failure or failures of the prototype ICs to meet the acceptance criteria as provided in the mask order sign off sheet or mutually agreed modifications thereof (the "Acceptance Criteria"). If CD Radio does not return the prototype ICs with a written rejection statement within such ninety (90) day period, then the design and prototype ICs shall be deemed to have been 17 approved by CD Radio and development work shall be deemed to have been completed by Lucent. If any prototype IC does not meet the Acceptance Criteria and is rejected by CD Radio, Lucent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace it with one which does comply with the Acceptance Criteria. Lucent shall not, however, be obligated to replace any noncomplying prototype ICs of which it has not been notified within ninety (90) days of shipment of same to CD Radio. If Lucent, within ninety (90) days after receipt of CD Radio's timely written rejection report, is unable to supply CD Radio with conforming prototype ICs, then either party may by written notice to the other terminate this Agreement as to such Device. Provided CD Radio has fulfilled all "Design HandOff Requirements," as defined in the Business Terms, if so terminated, unless otherwise provided in the Business Terms, all moneys paid by CD Radio to Lucent with respect to such Device will be refunded in full within thirty (30) days. Such refund of moneys shall be CD Radio's sole and exclusive remedy and Lucent's entire liability with respect to nonconforming prototype ICs. In the event that delivered prototype ICs comply with the Acceptance Criteria, but do not function in CD Radio's application (e.g., logic design error, change in required function, etc., not attributable to Lucent), CD Radio shall pay all charges incurred for the development of the Device and then CD Radio and Lucent may negotiate a mutually agreeable redesign schedule and price. 4. ORDERS No order for production quantities of the Device shall be placed by CD Radio or accepted by Lucent unless and until CD Radio has approved the prototype ICs for the Device, paid all fees then due under the Business Terms and made any other payments due to Lucent under any order based on this Agreement. All orders for the design of the Device, for changes, for technical assistance, for production quantities of the Device or for any other service by Lucent relating to this Agreement shall be in writing, shall reference the Business Terms by its number and date and any current amendments thereto by their respective dates, and shall be signed by CD Radio. Lucent shall acknowledge all orders in writing. 18 5. RESCHEDULING OF ORDERS CD Radio may reschedule an order pursuant to the following schedule: Days.....Time between date of reschedule request and current factory promise date. DAYS RESCHEDULE Within 30 days (030) No rescheduling 31 days to leadtime One time reschedule by up to 90 days beyond factory promised date is permitted with no further reschedule or cancellation. Beyond leadtime Reschedules and cancellations without limits. PULLIN WITHIN AGREED DELIVERY DATE CD Radio request date ("RD") may be pulled in as desired by CD Radio. Lucent will make reasonable efforts to meet the new RD. If improvement of the acknowledged date is possible, a new acknowledged date will be issued. If improvement cannot be made, the current acknowledged date will be retained; in all cases, the requested pullin date will be maintained with the order history in the event an improvement can be made at a later date. 6. CANCELLATION OF ORDERS Should CD Radio cancel any order which has been acknowledged and a shipping date assigned, either in whole or in part, such cancellation shall be upon terms and conditions that will compensate Lucent for any loss or damage resulting from such cancellation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lucent shall use its best efforts to mitigate any loss or damage resulting from such cancellation. Lucent shall not be obligated to permit a cancellation if a reschedule has been previously negotiated at CD Radio's request. Compensation by CD Radio for production quantities of the Device shall be according to the following schedule: Days.....Time between date of cancellation and current factory promise date. 19 Liability.....Liability is the percentage of aggregate purchase price of the canceled portion of the order. DAYS PERCENT OF LIABILITY 0 to leadtime 100 Greater than leadtime 0 7. WARRANTY Lucent warrants the Device as a production item ("Item"), but not related services or prototypes of any such Items, to be free from defects in material and workmanship and to be in conformance with the written specification contained in the Business Terms and amendments thereto, if any, and referenced in an order by CD Radio. With respect to prototype ICs, Lucent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure freedom from defects and conformity with written specifications, if any. If any defect in material or workmanship or failure to conform to such specification ("Defect") is suspected in any such Items, CD Radio, after obtaining a Returned Material Authorization Number from Lucent, shall ship suspected defective samples of the Items to Lucent, following Lucent's instructions regarding the return. No product will be accepted for repair, replacement, credit or refund without the written authorization of and in accordance with Lucent's instructions, which authorization and instructions shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Lucent shall analyze the failures, making use, when appropriate, of technical information provided by CD Radio relating to the circumstances surrounding the failures.
