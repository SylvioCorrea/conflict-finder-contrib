Each six (6) month fixed price period shall be for the period between April 1 and September 30 and between October 1 and March 31 for each year, respectively. 7.3.2 The exchange rate on every 1st and 15th day of each month shall be utilized for this calculation. In case any such day falls on a Japanese holiday or weekend, the exchange rate on the next Japanese business day shall be utilized. For the purpose of easier implementation of use of the average six (6) month exchange rate, the calculation period will begin 15 days prior to the beginning of the current expiring fixed price period as follows: (1) For the April 1 to September 30 fixed price period, the calculation period will commence the previous September 15th (first time) and end March 1st (12th time). (2) For the October 1 to March 31 fixed price period, the calculation period will commence the previous March 15th (1st time) and end September 1st (12th time). 7.3.3 In calculating the average six (6) month exchange rate, the highest and lowest rates shall be eliminated from the twelve (12) exchange rates utilized in order to avoid any irregular movement of currency. The remaining ten (10) exchange rates shall be averaged. 7.3.4 The source of the exchange rate information is the final exchange rate of the Tokyo market for the subject day as reported in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper. Internet address: http://www.nni.nikkei.co.jp 12 [***] CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED 7.3.5 HITACHI shall advise NANOGEN of the applicable Average Rate as well as the revised unit base price of HITACHI Products and NANOGEN Products pursuant to Sections 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.2.2 and 7.2.3. Except as otherwise set forth herein, such revised base prices shall be effective for any purchase orders placed by NANOGEN and HITACHI during the periods covered by those revised prices. The prices of the HITACHI Products and NANOGEN Products shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: [***] 7.3.6 NANOGEN and HITACHI shall equally share in the difference between the U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen exchange rate in effect at the beginning of the subject period (the &quot;Base Rate&quot;) and the above determined Average Rate. The initial Base Rate is set forth in EXHIBIT A of the Agreement. The Average Rate determined for a six month period shall become the Base Rate to be used for the following six month period. 7.4 In case a change of the base price of the HITACHI Products or NANOGEN Products becomes necessary for any reason, including a model change of the HITACHI Products or NANOGEN Products, a major change of the competitive situation in the relevant territory with respect to price performance, or any other reasonable cause, the Parties shall, in good faith, negotiate a new base price from HITACHI to NANOGEN, or NANOGEN to HITACHI, as the case may be. 7.5 HITACHI shall invoice NANOGEN at the time of shipment by HITACHI, and NANOGEN shall invoice HITACHI at the time of shipment by NANOGEN. Payment shall be made in U.S. dollars from NANOGEN to HII (with HII authorized to receive such payment on behalf of HITACHI), and HII to NANOGEN (with HII authorized to make such payment on behalf of HITACHI), within thirty (30) days after the issuance of such invoice. 7.6 Following the Commercial Production Determination, HITACHI shall pay NANOGEN a sales commission on sales of HITACHI Products made by HITACHI in the Japanese market during the term of this Agreement. The initial sales commission shall equal [***] of the estimated average sales price of such HITACHI Products. Such estimated average sales price shall be determined by the Parties at the same time as the prices for HITACHI Products are determined pursuant to 13 [***] CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3, and shall be effective through September 30 of the subject year. Such sales commission shall be calculated on the basis of sales made and invoiced by HITACHI during each calendar quarter, and shall be paid by HITACHI to NANOGEN within forty five (45) days of the close of each calendar quarter. Such commissions shall be paid in U.S. Dollars, with the conversion of Japanese Yen denominated sales proceeds to U.S. Dollars determined based on the U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen exchange rate in effect at the end of the subject calendar quarter. If in any such year or portion thereof ending with September 30 the total commissions paid are not equal to an agreed minimum commission, HITACHI shall, following the end of such year or portion thereof, pay NANOGEN the difference between the actual commissions paid during such year and that minimum commission amount. That minimum commission for the first year, ending with [***], shall be discussed at the time of the Commercial Production Determination and mutually agreed to by the Parties. The minimum commission for subsequent years shall be negotiated in good faith by the Parties at the same time as the prices for HITACHI Products for such year are determined pursuant to Section7.1.3, based on HITACHI's forecast of HITACHI Products sales in Japan during such year. 7.7 If HITACHI develops or purchases Other Products from a third party for sale in the Japanese market with HITACHI Products or NANOGEN Products during the term of this Agreement, HITACHI shall pay NANOGEN a sales commission on such sales in accordance with Section 7.6. 7.8 If HITACHI has reasonable grounds to conclude that the withholding of tax is required under applicable Japanese law on any payment to be made to NANOGEN hereunder, HITACHI may withhold such amount from such payment and pay such amount to the applicable tax authorities, with the balance of such payment to be made to NANOGEN. In such event, HITACHI shall notify NANOGEN of such payment, and, as soon as possible following such payment, shall provide NANOGEN with evidence of such tax payment and other documentation which would be reasonably required for a U.S. taxpayer to meet the requirements for claiming a tax credit on a U.S. federal income tax return. NANOGEN shall use its reasonable efforts to credit any such tax withheld by HITACHI against NANOGEN's U.S. tax liability, and if NANOGEN is able to so credit all or any amount of such withheld tax, NANOGEN shall promptly reimburse to HITACHI onehalf of the amount of such credit.
