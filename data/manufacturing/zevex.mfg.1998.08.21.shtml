Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cardiac Science desires to retain ZEVEX's services for a twophase project: (i) to provide development services for the development of a heart monitor and defibrillator device (the "Product") and to fabricate prototypes of the Product for verification testing and clinical validation; and (ii) if the prototypes pass the System Verification Requirements (as defined below), to manufacture the Product for delivery to Cardiac Science. ARTICLE I 1.1 SCOPE OF WORK AND DEVELOPMENT. ZEVEX shall (a) complete the electronic design of the Product in accordance with the specifications set forth in the Product Specifications set forth in Appendix II attached hereto and by reference made a part hereof (the "Product Specification"), (b) accomplish System Verification Testing on the entire instrument as set forth in the Statement of Work as set forth in Appendix III attached hereto and by reference made a part hereof (the "Statement of Work"), and (c) acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to purchase orders numbered 98010 and 98021 (the "Purchase Orders"), ZEVEX has already commenced the engineering and development efforts contemplated by this Agreement. Both the Parties agree that the Purchase Orders are valid and binding and are attached hereto as Appendix I and by reference made a part hereof. 1.2 DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES. ZEVEX shall develop Alpha units and Beta units and verification testing in accordance with the Statement of Work set forth in Appendix III. ZEVEX will diligently pursue completion of the work and will allocate sufficient staff and technical resources and use its best efforts to meet the deadlines and complete the work described herein. The parties shall cooperate to reach the market as quickly as possible with a quality product. 1.3 DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND CHANGES. ZEVEX will hold regular design reviews in accordance with its standard development operating procedures, which procedures call for reviews of at least preliminary design review, preproduct review, engineering release design review, and postdesign review. Cardiac Science shall be informed of the dates of these design review meetings at least one week in advance. If Cardiac Science does not attend, it will be required to sign off or provide comments on the minutes of that review within two working days of actual receipt. Change in project scope or specifications during development will be by mutual consent and will be quoted separately by ZEVEX if necessary. ZEVEX agrees to use its best efforts to accommodate Cardiac Science on such changes in scope and/or specifications as may be reasonably requested by Cardiac Science with appropriate changes in the purchase orders. Cardiac Science shall interface with ZEVEX personnel as requested by ZEVEX. 1.4 SYSTEM VERIFICATION TESTING. For all subsystems designed by ZEVEX as defined in the Statement of Work, ZEVEX shall draft appropriate verification protocol and perform the testing in Accordance with that protocol. Cardiac Science shall author the system verification protocol and Cardiac Science shall accomplish software verification and clinical validation of the Product ("System Verification Testing"). Cardiac Science has written the system protocol and ZEVEX shall test the system in accordance with that protocol. Regulatory Standards Testing shall be managed by ZEVEX. Third party testing shall be approved in advance by Cardiac Science and shall be paid by Cardiac Science. Test materials shall be the exclusive property of Cardiac Science and ZEVEX will not use them except as needed to perform hereunder. 1.5 REJECTION OF WORK. Should Cardiac Science determine, in the exercise of its reasonable good faith judgment, that any verification or testing of ZEVEX's work (including, without limitation, testing does not conform to applicable specifications, then Cardiac Science shall (i) notify ZEVEX of such problems; and (ii) permit ZEVEX a reasonable opportunity to make any necessary corrections. ZEVEX shall resubmit to Cardiac Science revised testing or other work corrected to meet the relevant specifications within thirty (30) days of notice to ZEVEX.

ZEVEX has estimated circuit board tooling in Appendix IV attached hereto and by reference made a part hereof (the "Deliverables.") Firm pricing will be provided once the circuit design and layout are complete. Tooling will be approved by Cardiac Science and invoiced by ZEVEX at cost as those costs are incurred. Design and procurement of tooling for injection molded plastic parts is the responsibility of Cardiac Science. Cardiac Science will utilize ZEVEX's established vendors when possible, provided that pricing and quality are competitive and approved by Cardiac Science. ZEVEX is responsible to qualify all vendors per their system requirements. Cardiac Science can request a requote of components. 1.7 COMPENSATION FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. In consideration for the services rendered by ZEVEX for Product Development, ZEVEX shall be paid as follows: 90,000 shares of Cardiac Science common stock (the "Shares") to be issued as follows: 30,000 shares at the time of placement of the purchase order, 30,000 shares at the time of acceptance of the Alpha units, and 30,000 shares at the time of completion of verification testing. In addition, ZEVEX shall also be paid $339,360 as follows: $10,000 each upon placement of each of the Purchase Orders, $129,480 upon Cardiac Science's acceptance of the Alpha units, and $129,480 upon completion of verification testing. The balance of $60,400 for outside laboratory testing and CPU circuit board tooling shall be paid when incurred. The fact that Cardiac Science makes the foregoing payments shall not imply Cardiac Science's acknowledgment that a particular event or milestone has been achieved. 1.8 INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS. ZEVEX represents and warrants that it is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by reason of being a corporation, not formed for the specific purpose of requiring the Shares, with total assets in excess of $5,000,000.
