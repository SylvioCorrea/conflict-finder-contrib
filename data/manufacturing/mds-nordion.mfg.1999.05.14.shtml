Connie Matsui VP, Planning & Resource Development IDEC Pharmaceuticals, 11011 Torreyana Rd., San Diego, CA 92121 Dear Connie: MDS Nordion offers the following proposal for an expedited schedule that we feel will meet the needs and expectations of both companies: 1. Initial upfront payment by IDEC of [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] upon full execution of this letter agreement. 2. Additional payments based on the following flowchart: [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] Milestone 1 is critical as it is the first quantifiable milestone which demonstrates whether or not MDS Nordion is meeting the expedited schedule. While material from this milestone may not be of clinical significance, it does increase the confidence level for completing the rest of the project according to the expedited schedule. It also gives IDEC the ability to gage when clinical material will be available. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED Milestone 2 is important as this represents the moment when IDEC can begin testing MDS Nordion sterile Y90 in patients. 3. Milestone definitions: [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] 4. In the event that MDS Nordion does not submit the DMF by [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] and is not impeded from doing so in any way, directly or indirectly, by IDEC the initial upfront payment of [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] and the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] Milestone 1 payment, if previously paid by IDEC to MDS Nordion, would be returned to IDEC. If you are satisfied with this proposal, please execute this letter in the space provided below and return a fully executed copy to my attention. A fully executed copy shall be deemed an amendment to the Agreement dated May 14, 1999 and except as set forth in this amendment, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Nordion shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to establish a second Isotope manufacturing facility ("New Facility") which is substantially similar to the facility currently used by Nordion in Kanata, Ontario to manufacture Isotope in accordance with the following project schedule: [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED It is understood and acknowledged by the parties that the Completion Dates and the sequence for carrying out the above activities shall serve only as a guide. Nordion will use commercially reasonable best efforts to complete projects in advance of stated Completion Dates. IDEC, however, acknowledges that Nordion's ability to meet the Completion Dates above depends heavily on the ability of external vendors and consultants to complete projects in a timely manner. 2. (a) In consideration of Nordion's obligations in Section 1 above, IDEC agrees that it shall not exercise its termination rights set forth in Section 17.3 of the Agreement and such termination right, except as set out below, shall be suspended until such time as Nordion's cumulative gross revenues received during the Commercial Phase from the sale of Isotope under the Agreement reaches [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. Nordion shall notify IDEC as soon as Nordion becomes aware that the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] has been reached. (b) In the event that Nordion does not submit the updated Drug Master File (DMF) for the New Facility on or prior to [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], IDEC's right of termination under Section 17.3 of the Agreement shall revive. In the event IDEC exercises its termination right under the revived termination provisions of Section 17.3 of the Agreement prior to the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], IDEC [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], pay to Nordion a lump sum amount equal to the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. In the event that IDEC fails to make such payment in accordance with this paragraph, IDEC's termination notice shall be of no force and effect. For purposes of this Second Amendment, [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. (c) Notwithstanding Section 2(a) or (b), IDEC may terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 17.3 of the Agreement at any time prior to BLA approval. In the event that IDEC exercises its right to terminate the Agreement, pursuant to this section 2(c) or Nordion terminates the Agreement pursuant to Section 17.6 of the Agreement, IDEC, [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], shall pay Nordion a lump sum amount equal to [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. In the event IDEC fails to make such payment IDEC's termination notice shall be of no force and effect. 2 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED (d) IDEC acknowledges that the amount and payment of the foregoing is fair and reasonable. The parties further acknowledge that Nordion shall not be required to manufacture Isotope in the New Facility until immediately prior to such time as capacity of the initial facility is exceeded. (e) In consideration of the payment set out in Section 2(b) or 2(c) above, Nordion agrees that IDEC may at any time within [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] following the effective date of termination reinstate the Agreement upon [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] prior written notice to Nordion, provided such notice of reinstatement is accompanied by a payment to Nordion of [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. Such payment of [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] shall be reduced to [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] if prior to such date of termination Nordion had yet to submit an updated DMF. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Agreement, as reinstated, shall apply to the New Facility only. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2(e), in the event Nordion advises IDEC in writing during the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] that it has initiated negotiations with a third party regarding use of the New Facility, IDEC shall have [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] from the date of such notification to elect to reinstate the Agreement in accordance with this Section 2(e) or waive such right of reinstatement. In the event IDEC waives such right of reinstatement and Nordion's negotiations with such third party fail to result in an agreement to utilize the New Facility, Nordion shall promptly notify IDEC and IDEC shall again have the right of reinstatement set forth in this Section 2(e) until expiration of the original [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], subject to Nordion's continuing right to initiate negotiations with a third party and to require IDEC to elect to reinstate the Agreement or waive such right in [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. 3. IDEC's right of audit set forth in Section 11.1 of the Agreement shall be extended for the purpose of verifying [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] and fulfillment of Nordion's obligations described in Section 2. 4. IDEC and Nordion are contemplating the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] and a third amendment to the Agreement ("Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment shall delineate milestones and timelines related to the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. The Third Amendment may also amend, among other things, dose size, purchase price, minimum purchase requirements, distribution obligations and termination rights set forth in the Agreement. 5. IDEC and Nordion agree to negotiate the terms and conditions of the Third Amendment in good faith and in an effort to enter into the Third Amendment on or before [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. 6. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon the terms of and enter into the Third Amendment on or before [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] (which date may be extended by the mutual agreement of the parties in writing), IDEC may at any time thereafter enter into an agreement with a third party Yttrium90 isotope supplier and, as of the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], IDEC's obligation to purchase from Nordion [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] 3 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED], shall be null and void and of no further force or effect. In the event IDEC obtains supply of Yttrium90 for commercial, as opposed to clinical, use from a third party as provided in this Section 6, and Nordion [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] to continue to perform its obligations under the Agreement, Nordion shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement upon [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] prior written notice to IDEC. IDEC agrees that it shall notify Nordion in writing in the event it obtains supply of Yttrium90 from a third party for commercial use with the Monoclonal Antibody in the United States. 7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Agreement, the purchase price for Isotope delivered during the Commercial Phase to radiopharmacies and other entities for the sole purpose of Isotope dose calibration shall be [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] of the purchase price otherwise payable under Section 7.5 of the Agreement. To the extent IDEC requests that Nordion increase the Batch size during the Clinical Trial Phase or PreCommercial Phase to provide Isotope to radiopharmacies and other entities for the sole purpose of Isotope dose calibration, the price of such additional Isotope beyond the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] and required for dose calibration, shall be [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] of the price payable under Section 6.4 of the Agreement. 8. Capitalized terms not defined in this Second Amendment shall have the meanings given them in the Agreement. 9. This Second Amendment shall be effective as of the 2nd day of January 2001. Except as amended by the first and Second Amendment, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
