The Price during any period after the first anniversary of the Commencement of Commercial Manufacturing shall be determined in accordance with the following: (a) Annual Review. On each yearly anniversary of this Agreement following Commencement of Commercial Manufacturing, Patheon and Santarus will meet (in person or by telephone or video conference) to consider whether any adjustment to the Price in respect of the Finished Products upward or downward is appropriate to account for increases or decreases in the cost of manufacture and/or the cost of Raw Materials. In considering whether a change in the Price is justified, the Parties may consider all published economic data, including without limitation, price indices that are demonstrated to have a rational connection to the cost of Raw Materials or Patheon's cost of manufacturing the Finished Product. (b) Extraordinary Changes in Raw Material Costs. If at any time market conditions result in Patheon's cost of Raw Materials being materially greater than normal forecasted increases, then Patheon shall be entitled to request an adjustment to the Price to compensate it for such increased Raw Material costs. If at any time market conditions result in Patheon's cost of Raw Materials being materially lesser than anticipated, then Santarus shall be entitled to request an adjustment to the Price to compensate it for such reduced Raw Material costs. For the purposes of this Section 6.2(b), changes materially greater than normal forecasted increases or materially lesser than anticipated shall be considered to have occurred if: (i) the cost of a Raw Material increases or decreases, as applicable, by *** or more of the cost for that Raw Material upon which the Price then in effect was based; or (ii) the aggregate cost for all Raw Materials required to manufacture the Finished Product increases or decreases, as applicable, by *** or more of the total Raw Material costs for the Finished Product upon which the Price then in effect was based. To the extent that the Price has been previously adjusted pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) to reflect an increase or decrease in the cost of one or more Raw Materials, the adjustments provided for in (i) and (ii) above shall operate based on the costs attributed to such Raw Material (or Raw Materials) at the time the last such adjustments were made. In connection with a Price review pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 6.2, Patheon shall deliver to Santarus reasonably detailed documentation concerning increases or decreases in the cost of Raw Materials or Patheon's cost of manufacturing to facilitate the discussion. In connection with all fee adjustment requests pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 6.2, Patheon shall deliver to Santarus a revised Exhibit B and such budgetary pricing information or other documentation reasonably sufficient to demonstrate that a Price adjustment is justified, provided that Patheon shall have no obligation to provide any supporting documents to the extent such documents are subject to obligations of confidentiality between Patheon and its suppliers. Each of Santarus and Patheon shall forthwith use all reasonable efforts to agree on a revised Price in respect of each affected Finished Product. In the event the Parties are unable to reach agreement concerning adjustments to the Price, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Article 13. Until such time as dispute is resolved the price per Finished Product shall be the most current mutually agreed upon Price adjusted by an amount equal to the actual increase in that portion of *** Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission. 19 the Price that relates to Patheon's labour costs as reasonably demonstrated by Patheon; provided, however, that following resolution of any dispute regarding Price, the Price agreed upon as part of the dispute resolution shall be applied retroactively for any applicable periods. 6.3 PAYMENT TERMS.

Santarus may terminate this Agreement if at any time it decides to no longer market the Finished Product by giving Patheon six (6) months advance written notice of termination. 11.7 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

Patheon shall cooperate with Santarus and assist in the transfer to Santarus of all legal and technical documents concerning API and Finished Products, including master batch records, validation reports, stability reports and relevant manufacturer authorizations, existing retention samples and all such other documents and materials as may be reasonably necessary or useful for Santarus to source Finished Products from other qualified Third Parties. 11.8 ACCRUED RIGHTS. Termination, relinquishment, or expiration of this Agreement for any reason shall be without prejudice to any right which shall have accrued to the benefit of either Party prior to such termination, relinquishment, or expiration. Such termination, relinquishment or expiration shall not relieve either Party from obligations which are expressly indicated to survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. The provisions of this Article shall not limit or restrict the rights of any Party to seek remedies or take measures that may be otherwise available to it at law or equity in connection with the enforcement and performance of obligations under this Agreement.

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 12.5 SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO LIMIT THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION OF EITHER 30 PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF DAMAGES OR LOSSES CLAIMED BY A THIRD PARTY AS BEING INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR OTHER LIKE DAMAGES OR LOSSES. 12.6 INSURANCE.
