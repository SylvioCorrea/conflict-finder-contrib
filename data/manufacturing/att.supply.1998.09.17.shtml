NONEXCLUSIVE MARKET RIGHTS This Agreement neither grants to Supplier an exclusive right or privilege to sell, license or Lease to Company any or all Equipment, Software, Services or Materials described in this Agreement which Company may require, nor requires the purchase, license or Lease of any Equipment, Software, Services or Materials from Supplier by Company. Company may contract with other manufacturers and suppliers for the acquisition of comparable Equipment, Software, Services or Materials. Purchases, licenses or leases by Company under this Agreement shall be initiated by the placement of an Order by Company and the Order shall not 41 restrict the right of Company to cease acquisition nor require Company to continue any level of acquisition from Supplier.

RIGHT OF ENTRY AND PLANT RULES Each party shall have the right to enter the premises of the other party during normal business hours with respect to the performance of this Agreement, subject to all plant rules and regulations, security regulations and procedures and U.S. Government clearance requirements, if applicable. Supplier shall become acquainted with conditions governing the delivery, receipt and storage of Materials and Equipment at the site of the Services so that Supplier will not interfere with Company's operations. Storage space will not necessarily be provided adjacent to the site of the Services. Therefore, Supplier shall be expected to select, uncrate, remove and transport Materials and Equipment from the storage areas provided. Company is not responsible for the safekeeping of Supplier's property on Company's premises. Supplier shall not stop, delay or interfere with Company's work schedule without the prior approval of Company's Representative. Supplier shall provide and maintain sufficient covering and take any other precautions necessary to protect Company's stock, equipment and other property from damage due to Supplier's performance of the Services. 43 SEVERABILITY If any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the entire Agreement or Order, but rather the entire Agreement or Order shall be construed as if not containing the particular invalid or unenforceable provision or provisions, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. SHIPPING Supplier shall, at its expense, do all of the following: 1. Ship the Equipment, Software and Materials to the site designated in an accepted Order by the date set forth in the accepted Order in accordance with specific shipping instructions. If Supplier anticipates that an accepted Order will be delayed more than 24 hours past the due date stated in the accepted Order, Supplier will immediately notify Company's representative as designated on the accepted Order, 2. Place the accepted Order number on all subordinate documents, 3. Enclose a packing memorandum with each shipment, and when more than one (1) package is shipped, identify the one containing the memorandum, 4. Mark the accepted Order number on all packages and shipping papers, and. 5. Furnish adequate protective packing at no additional charge. If Supplier does not comply with the F.O.B. terms of an Order or with Company's shipping or routing instructions, Supplier authorizes Company to deduct from any invoice of Supplier (or charge back to Supplier), any increased costs incurred by Company as a result of Supplier's noncompliance. STANDARDS Employees of Supplier with records of criminal convictions, other than minor traffic violations, shall not be assigned to Company's premises until a detailed statement of the circumstances is furnished to Company for its review, and Company has given its written approval of such assignment. In fulfilling Supplier's obligations under this clause, Supplier shall comply fully with all laws relating to the making of investigative reports and the disclosure of information contained therein. 44 SUPPLIER'S INFORMATION Except for documentation provided hereunder, and notification of significant bugs, Supplier shall not provide under, or have provided in contemplation of, this Agreement any Information or Medium, unless Supplier has the right to do so, and Supplier shall not view any of the Information as confidential or proprietary. Further, there are no limitations on the Use of Software except as otherwise agreed to in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, Company will protect Software received from Supplier with the same degree of care that Company normally uses to protect its own Software that it does not wish to become public knowledge, and Company will advise any recipient of such Software of that obligation under this Agreement. SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS The obligations of the parties under this Agreement, which by their nature would continue beyond the termination, cancellation or expiration of this Agreement, including, by way of illustration only and not limitation, those in the COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, IDENTIFICATION, IMPLEADER, INDEMNITY, INFRINGEMENT, INSURANCE, RELEASES VOID, USE OF INFORMATION, LICENSE GRANT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, SOURCE CODE LICENSE, MEDIATION and WARRANTY clauses, shall survive termination, cancellation or expiration of this Agreement. TAXES Company agrees to pay any applicable sales, use, excise, import or export tax, valueadded or similar tax, customs, duties, tariffs and similar charges levied upon the delivery of Supplier's products (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Tax&quot; or &quot;Taxes&quot;); provided, however, that Company shall not pay or be responsible for any taxes (i) with respect to which Company has advised Supplier of an exemption and provided all reasonably required substantiation, (ii) imposed on or in respect of Supplier's net or gross income, or (iii) imposed on or in respect of bringing Supplier's products to Supplier's shipping point. Taxes payable by Company shall be shown as separately billed items on Supplier's invoices in a form adequate to obtain any applicable recovery or credit and shall not be included in Supplier's prices. Supplier shall make every reasonable effort to assist and inform Company of the possible Taxes that may apply. Company shall have the right to have Supplier contest any such Taxes that Company deems improperly levied, at Company's expense and subject to Company's direction and control. If the nontaxability of the subject transaction is disputed in any audit or assessment of Supplier or a claim for refund for such Taxes is refused by any jurisdiction, then Supplier shall promptly notify Company in writing of such assessment or refusal. Company shall have the right, by notifying Supplier within 30 days of receipt by Company of such notice, to assume control of the conduct and resolution of such dispute, provided that Company shall have acknowledged in writing that it shall indemnify and hold harmless Supplier from and against any damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that arise out of or 45 result from any claim that Company has failed to pay any such Taxes and fees. Failure by Supplier to provide this notification to Company shall relieve Company of its indemnification obligation to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the rights of Company to fully defend its position with respect to the nontaxability of these transactions. TIMELY PERFORMANCE If either party has knowledge that anything prevents or threatens to prevent the timely performance of the Services under this Agreement, either party shall immediately notify the other party thereof and include all relevant information concerning the delay or potential delay. TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT Unless otherwise specifically provided in an Order, Supplier shall be responsible for providing all labor, tools and equipment (&quot;Tools&quot;) for performance of an Order. If Supplier actually uses any Tools owned or rented by Company or its customers, Supplier acknowledges that Supplier accepts the Tools &quot;as is, where is&quot; and that neither Company nor its customers have any responsibility for the condition or state of repair of the Tools and that Supplier shall have risk of loss and damage to such Tools. Supplier shall not remove the Tools from Company's or its customers' premises and shall return the Tools to Company or its customers upon completion of use, or at such earlier time as Company or its customers may request, in the same condition as when received by Supplier, reasonable wear and tear excepted. USE OF INFORMATION Supplier shall view as Company's property any Information or Medium, however conveyed, provided to, or acquired by, Supplier under or in contemplation of this Agreement or an Order. Supplier shall, at no charge to Company, and as Company directs, destroy or surrender to Company promptly at its request any such Medium or any copy of such Information. Supplier shall keep Information confidential and use it only in performing under this Agreement or an Order and obligate its employees, subcontractors and others working for it to do so, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to Information previously known to Supplier free of obligation, made public through no fault imputable to Supplier. VARIATION OF QUANTITY Company assumes no liability for Equipment, Software, or Materials produced, processed or shipped in excess of the amount specified in any Order placed with Supplier. WAIVER The failure of either party at any time to enforce any right or remedy available to it under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to any breach or failure by the other party shall not be construed to be a waiver of that right or remedy with respect to any other breach or failure by the other party. 46 WORK DONE BY OTHERS If any part of the Services performed by Supplier is dependent upon Services done by others, Supplier shall inspect and promptly report to Company any defect that renders the other work unsuitable for Supplier's proper performance. Supplier's silence shall constitute approval of the other work as fit, proper and suitable for Supplier's performance of the Services or other work. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Agreement shall incorporate the typed or written provisions on Company's Orders issued pursuant to this Agreement and shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Order(s) and shall not be modified or rescinded, except by a writing signed by duly authorized representatives of Supplier and AT&amp;T Corp.
