AMENDMENT TO FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT between Novoste Corporation 4350 / C International Boulevard Norcross, GA 30093/3027 represented by its Chief Operating Officer David N. Gill hereinafter referred to as "NOVOSTE" and BEBIG Isotopentechnik und Umweltdiagnostik GmbH RobertRossleStra(beta)e 10, 13125 Berlin represented by its managing director Dr. Andreas Eckert hereinafter referred to as "BEBIG" Preamble 1. NOVOSTE produces medical devices and has developed a catheter for the inhibition and prevention of restenosis of a blood vessel after interventional therapy (hereinafter referred to as "Restenosis Device"). 2. BEBIG manufactures radioactive sealed Strontium90 sources (BEBIG Product Code SrO.SO 3) in units called seedtrains usable in the Restenosis device (hereinafter referred to as "SeedTrains"). 3. On November 24th, 1994 the parties hereto concluded an agreement under the term "RESTENOSIS THERAPY PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT", amended by the "FRAME AGREEMENT CONTAINING PURCHASE ORDER PROVISION AND INVESTMENT GRANT" dated November 15, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the "FrameworkAgreement"), dealing et. al. with the supply of SeedTrains to NOVOSTE. Additionally, BEBIG granted NOVOSTE an option to purchase all of BEBIG's tangible and intangible assets required for the production of SeedTrains under an agreement called the "OPTION TO PURCHASE ASSETS AGREEMENT" dated September 1st, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Option Agreement"). 4.a) In August 1997, BEBIG started building a new automated seed production line. It turned out that the line was more expensive than expected. Also, BEBIG decommissioned the earlier (contaminated) Strontium90 prototype line and had to absorb substantial cost. b) At the same time both parties realized that there are desirable changes in the design of the Seed Trains that may increase their technical life time and improve their quality. c) Furthermore, both parties see a need to address the issue of recycling and disposal of used radioactive trains. 5. The parties hereto mutually agree that (i) the Framework Agreement shall be adapted for recent developments, (ii) the Purchase Option Agreement shall be altered by a special security agreement leaving the contractual framework of the Purchase Option Agreement in other respects unchanged. A. Amendment of the Framework Agreement I. Para. 1 of the Framework Agreement shall be revised as follows: "ss. 1 Payment Liability 1. The customer now pays an additional investment grant to the supplier amounting to an aggregate of DM 1,000,000.00 (in words: German Marks one million) in the following installments: DM 700,000.00 within one week after the initial delivery of "active" SeedTrains (XXXXX); DM 300,000.00 within one week after delivery of the XXXXX active SeedTrain (XXXXX). 2. The aforementioned installments are to be paid free of charge to the account no. 0000424648 at the Commerzbank Berlin, code number (Bankleitzahl) 120 400 00." ss. 2 Changing in the Pricing Formula a) BEBIG and NOVOSTE agree to a new pricing formula that will take into account the time Seed Trains are used. For any trains that are delivered after the execution of this agreement, NOVOSTE will pay to BEBIG US$ XXXXX for any XXXXX period a train is in use. The US$ XXXXX price is exclusive of freight and packaging. Confidential treatment has been requested for portions of this page of this exhibit. The copy filed herewith omits the information subject to the confidentiality request. Omissions are designated as "XXXXX". The portions omitted have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to such request for confidential treatment. b) For the first XXXXX trains delivered to NOVOSTE after the execution of this Agreement, the XXXXX period shall commence with the day of the first clinical use of the train. At the end of the XXXXX period NOVOSTE has one month time to test each train and either (1) return it to BEBIG for recycling or (2) XXXXX. Novoste will provide Bebig with true and accurate information about the date of first clinical use. c) For any SeedTrains delivered thereafter, the XXXXX period shall commence with the date of manufacture, as evidenced by the manufacturer's certificate, provided that: (1) BEBIG has delivered XXXXX SeedTrains, which pass NOVOSTE's specifications on P.O. 970381 to NOVOSTE prior to XXXXX or over any consecutive XXXXX period once deliveries commence. (2) No more than 10 days transpire between date of manufacture and receipt by NOVOSTE (just in time delivery), (3) The date of manufacture cannot predate the desired delivery date in NOVOSTE's purchase order by 30 days (should BEBIG decide to build on a speculative basis prior to a NOVOSTE purchase order). II. Any other provisions under the Framework remain unchanged as far as they are not (i) amended, or replaced by the aforementioned clauses or (ii) settled otherwise (e. g. expiry of time, performance). Confidential treatment has been requested for portions of this page of this exhibit. The copy filed herewith omits the information subject to the confidentiality request. Omissions are designated as "XXXXX". The portions omitted have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to such request for confidential treatment. ss. 3 Recycling of radioactive Seed Trains/Decommissioning a) BEBIG will accept free of charge, for the period until August 22, 2002, returned radioactive SeedTrains from NOVOSTE, as long as the following conditions are met: (1) The number of returned trains in any given year that are unfit for recycling ("Disposal Trains") does not exceed 20 % of the total number of returned trains in that year. (2) The sum of returned trains for any given year is not larger than the sum of new trains shipped out during that period. b) Both parties will work together in good faith to find an economic solution for trains that do not meet these conditions. B.

This investment obligation has been increased by an additional amount of DM 1,000,000.00 by the foregoing Agreement under A.

Expectant right, ownership and coownership in the Security Collateral A are transferred at the date hereof; expectant right, ownership and coownership in those parts of the Security Collateral A being brought into the Premises later on are transferred at the time of the actual deposit.

Omissions are designated as "XXXXX". The portions omitted have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to such request for confidential treatment. 2.3 Security Collateral B BEBIG herewith assigns all of its rights in the Security Collateral B to NOVOSTE.

BEBIG's right to make use of the Security Collateral B in the ordinary course of its business remains unaffected subject to the regulation under Para. 5 hereunder. BEBIG guarantees that it is unrestrictedly entitled to dispose of the Security Collateral B to the aforementioned extent. ss. 3 Duties of BEBIG 3.1 BEBIG shall refrain from any disposal of the Security Collateral A and B except with (i) NOVOSTE's explicit prior consent not unreasonably withheld and (ii) limited to disposals due to normal wear, repair and replacement.

Option to Acquire Unrestricted Title 5.1 The Security Object agreed upon in Para. 1 hereunder and BEBIG's claim for retransfer of title according to Para. 4.1 hereunder are subject to the condition subsequent that NOVOSTE submits a written notice to BEBIG that all rights in the Security Collateral A and B shall finally be forfeited in favor of NOVOSTE (hereinafter referred to as the "Notice"). NOVOSTE's right to acquire unrestricted title in the Security Collateral A and B by submitting the Notice to BEBIG shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Option". The Option may be exercised at any time until September 1st, 2002 subject to an extension of the term of the Option by a mutual written agreement of the parties hereto (hereinafter referred to as the "Option Period") for the amount of US$ 4,019,400 Million (four million nineteen thousand four hundred USdollars) (see Para. 8). 5.2 In the Notice NOVOSTE shall specify a date for closing the acquisition (hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date") which shall occur at least ninety (90) days but no more than two hundred seventy (270) days subsequent to the date of the Notice. ss. 6 NonAssumption of Liabilities NOVOSTE shall not assume, discharge or be liable for any debts, liabilities or obligations of BEBIG including, without limitation, any (a) liabilities or obligations of BEBIG to its creditors or equity owners; (b) liabilities or obligations of BEBIG with respect to any transactions; (c) taxes or other liabilities or obligations of BEBIG incurred in connection with the grant of the Option pursuant to this Agreement; or (d) contingent liabilities or obligations of BEBIG.

However, if (1) NOVOSTE exercises the Option and wishes to move the assets to another location, or (2) NOVOSTE does less than US$ XXXXX in seed business with BEBIG from August 1, 1998 to August 31, 2002, then NOVOSTE agrees to pay BEBIG the costs to decontaminate the strontium 90 line assets, up to a maximum of DM 500,000. Confidential treatment has been requested for portions of this page of this exhibit. The copy filed herewith omits the information subject to the confidentiality request. Omissions are designated as "XXXXX". The portions omitted have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to such request for confidential treatment. ss. 7 Facilitation Appurtenant to the transfer of the Security Collateral A and B in connection with the exercise of the Option and covered by the Purchase Price, BEBIG shall assign at its expense such personnel bearing the necessary technical and operational expertise to spend up to three (3) months at NOVOSTE (or its assignee or successor) facilitating the transfer of the Security Collateral A and B and training personnel as to the operation of the Security Collateral A and B as a SeedTrain producing business. BEBIG shall also assign at its expense for up to three (3) months such personnel bearing essential administrative and regulatory expertise to guide NOVOSTE (or its assignee or successor) in licensing and approval processes with which BEBIG has relevant experience. ss. 8 Purchase Price 8.1 The purchase price (hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Price") for the Security Collateral A and B to be acquired upon exercise of the Option shall be 4,019,400 Million dollars (four million nineteen thousand four hundred US dollars). 8.2 The option agreement will be exercised in the following manner. 1.

Once Novoste has paid Bebig an aggregate of $ 4,019,400 towards the option purchase price, either in the form of license fees or an accelerated cash payment, then the title to all tangible assets used on the line will automatically be transferred to Novoste at that time, and Novoste will receive a fullypaid license to all intangible assets and intellectual property used in the design and manufacture of the seed trains. 5. Novoste does not guarantee a certain purchase volume in any one year. Novoste continues to have until August 31, 2002 to pay for the option in full. C. Common Final Provisions 1.
