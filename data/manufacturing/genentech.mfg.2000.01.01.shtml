In addition, Alkermes and Genentech shall agree on mutually acceptable inventory procedures to assure compliance with FDA and financial auditing requirements. SECTION 3: PURCHASE ORDERS; PROCESSING 3.1 GENENTECH SUPPLY FORECAST AND PROCESSING PLAN. (a) SUPPLY FORECAST. At least thirty (30) days prior to the start of each calendar [***], Genentech will provide Alkermes with Genentech's good faith nonbinding written projection of Processing for which Alkermes shall be responsible for the next [***], including estimates of the Genentech Materials to be delivered to Alkermes during such period and the nature of the Processing to be performed, which rolling [***] forecast, as amended from time to time by Genentech, shall be the "SUPPLY FORECAST". Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during any given calendar [***] Genentech reasonably believes that the most recently delivered Supply Forecast is no longer an accurate projection, Genentech shall promptly inform Alkermes as to the circumstances that have changed and if necessary, deliver a new Supply Forecast with corrected projections. (b) PROCESSING PLAN. Based on factors including anticipated demand, the Supply Forecast, the availability of Alkermes' Processing capacity in the Facilities and comparable 5 6 THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH "*" AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. Alkermes facilities, changes in Batch sizes, Dosage Containers and/or Specifications, and anticipated changes in any of the foregoing, on an ongoing basis during the Term, Genentech no later than sixty (60) days before the start of each calendar [***] will provide Alkermes with a written processing plan (each, a "PROCESSING PLAN") for [***]. Among other things, each Processing Plan shall specify the Genentech Materials to be delivered to Alkermes during the period covered by such Processing Plan, the amount of Bulk Product (expressed in kilograms) to be delivered to Alkermes for Processing, the nature of the Processing to be performed (including whether Bulk Product should be Processed into Finished Product or Finished Form, the number of Dosage Containers (vials) of each that Genentech requests to be delivered, and the amount of material, by weight, to be placed in such Dosage Containers), and the approximate timing of shipment of Finished Form and/or Finished Product. [***] Each Processing Plan shall be binding as to the first [***] and nonbinding as to the next [***]. In the event that Genentech delivers a Processing Plan to Alkermes that widely diverges (unless agreed to by the parties taking into account then current circumstances, divergences of greater than [***] shall be considered "wide" divergences) from the Processing Plan delivered the previous [***] in terms of the amount of Bulk Product that Genentech will send to Alkermes or the amount of Finished Form or Finished Product to be Processed, such that it will not have the capacity to accommodate such Processing, Alkermes shall promptly notify Genentech, and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such capacity issue. Within twenty (20) days of receipt of each Processing Plan, Alkermes will acknowledge it in writing, thereby committing for Processing the Facilities, all Dedicated Equipment and Genentech Equipment at the Facilities used in Processing, sufficient appropriately trained Alkermes personnel and all other Alkermes resources required under this Agreement for Processing. The Parties may mutually agree in writing to amend a Processing Plan, based on factors including those listed in this SECTION 3.1(b). If both Parties agree, an alternative method of providing Processing Plans may be used in which the demand for Finished Form or Finished Product could take into account more than one [***]. 3.2 PURCHASE ORDERS; CHANGE ORDERS AND BINDING AMOUNT. On an ongoing basis, Genentech will order Processing under each Processing Plan pursuant to individual purchase orders specifying the number of Dosage Containers (vials) of Finished Form or Finished Product, as the case may be, that Genentech requests to be delivered, the number of Dosage Containers that should be included in each Batch, the amount of material, by weight, to be placed in such Dosage Containers, and shipping instructions. Genentech will submit each purchase order to Alkermes at least fortyfive (45) days in advance of the first desired shipping date listed on the purchase order, and, except as set forth below, Alkermes shall ship Finished Form and Finished Product, as the case may be, together with Alkermes' certificate of analysis and certificate of compliance, in conformance with the shipping dates set forth in such purchase orders. Alkermes may suggest alternative shipping date(s) so long as they satisfy Genentech's supply requirements under the Processing Plan, and the Parties will confirm any rescheduled shipping date(s) in writing. Genentech may modify a purchase order only by submitting a written change order to Alkermes at least thirty (30) days in advance of the relevant shipping date covered by the change order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alkermes shall use reasonable efforts to accommodate a change order submitted less than thirty (30) days in advance of such shipping date. The aggregate amount of Finished Product and Finished Form ordered by Genentech in all purchase orders with delivery dates in a given [***] must be within [***] of the amount forecasted to be 6 7 THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH "*" AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. ordered in the binding Processing Plan for such [***], unless the divergence in question is less than [***] Dosage Containers. If such aggregate amount is more than [***] under such forecasted amount and the difference is greater than [***] Dosage Containers, Alkermes will notify Genentech who will have 15 days to designate the dosage form, number of Dosage Containers and the shipping instructions to make up the difference. If Alkermes does not receive such instructions within 15 days of its notice to Genentech, then Alkermes will ship to Genentech that amount of Finished Form and/or Finished Product, in the dosage form that Alkermes chooses to make up such difference. 3.3 DEGREE OF EFFORT; UNPLANNED DELAY OR ELIMINATION OF PROCESSING. Each Party will use commercially reasonable best efforts to meet each Processing Plan and purchase orders (subject to change orders) and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, Alkermes will Process a given Campaign until it has completely Processed each Batch within such Campaign. Alkermes will provide Genentech with as much advance notice as possible (and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least fifteen (15) days' advance written notice where possible) if Alkermes determines that any Processing will be delayed or eliminated for any reason. Thereafter, the Parties agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide the maximum possible amount of conforming Finished Product to Genentech, subject to SECTION 4.3. 3.4 WARRANTIES. Each Party warrants and covenants that it will perform all its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Genentech warrants and covenants that all Genentech Materials will meet applicable Specifications and will have been produced in compliance with cGMPs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Alkermes warrants and covenants that (i) Finished Form or Finished Product that it has Processed, and all Alkermes Materials, will meet the Specifications and is expected to do so over their approved shelf life, as the case may be, based on stability trend results; (ii) Finished Form or Finished Product that it has Processed, and all Alkermes Materials, will have been produced in compliance with applicable SOPs, and with FDA and European Union cGMPs and validated parameters demonstrated to meet sterility assurance levels required for an aseptically processed sterile parenteral product; (iii) Finished Form or Finished Product that it has Processed, and all Alkermes Materials, shall conform to the requirements set forth in the applicable New Drug Application and Marketing Authorization Application; (iv) [***] and (v) that it will store and handle all Genentech Materials, Dedicated Equipment and Genentech Equipment in accordance with the relevant procedures. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 3.4, THE PARTIES MAKE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. 3.5 GENENTECH INSPECTION AND PROCESSING INPUT. During the Term, Genentech representatives may inspect the Facilities during regular business hours. Before, during and after each Campaign, Genentech may base a reasonable number of Genentech representatives (currently estimated to be 2 people) at the Facilities to oversee Processing, and Alkermes will provide the Genentech representatives with work space and access to telephone, facsimile and electronic mail services at Alkermes as reasonably necessary. Alkermes shall consult regularly with the Genentech representatives, and will not unreasonably reject suggestions or recommendations made by such representatives in writing (or orally if promptly confirmed in writing) relating to the Processing. Alkermes will promptly correct any aspect of the Alkermes Materials, the Genentech Equipment or Dedicated Equipment located at Alkermes, any other machinery, equipment or utilities at Alkermes used in Processing or the Processing itself that Genentech, acting in good faith, notifies Alkermes in writing (or orally if confirmed in 7 8 THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH "*" AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. writing) is not in compliance with this Agreement (including the Specifications) or applicable laws and regulations (including cGMPs). Any such corrections will be performed in compliance with the applicable change control SOP (CS010033) where appropriate. 3.6 ALKERMES MODIFICATIONS; SAFETY. Except as required in SECTION 3.5 or the Specifications or with Genentech's prior written consent, Alkermes will not modify the Genentech Equipment or Dedicated Equipment at all, and Alkermes will not modify the Facilities, plant operating procedures or any machinery, equipment or utilities at Alkermes used in Processing if it would directly affect Processing or the then current Processing Plan. Before making any such change, Alkermes will give Genentech advance written notice of the nature and effective date of such change per applicable standard operating procedures (SOP CS010033; Change Control). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree to collaborate in good faith to modify the equipment, plant operating procedures or machinery [***], and the Parties agree not to unreasonably withhold approval of implementation of any such modifications or improvements, although this good faith collaboration shall not change the financial responsibilities of the Parties set forth herein or in the License Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the Specifications and Alkermes' plant operating procedures, the Specifications will control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any change to the Facilities, machinery, equipment, utilities or the operating procedures necessary to protect the immediate safety of Alkermes' employees will be considered an "emergency change" as described in SOP CS010033; change control. 3.7 PROCESSING DEVIATIONS. In the event that Alkermes encounters any significant problem with or deviation from its standard operating procedures, plant operating procedures or the Specifications, or recognizes an unexpected need for such a deviation, during a Campaign, Alkermes will notify Genentech immediately and will suspend Processing if such suspension does not adversely affect ongoing Processing or employee safety. Genentech shall respond as promptly as is reasonably practicable. Any changes to the process documentation shall be subject to Genentech review and approval, as set forth in SOP CS010033. SECTION 4: LIABILITY 4.1 TESTING AND REJECTION OF FINISHED PRODUCT. Alkermes will provide Genentech, accompanying each delivery of Finished Form and/or Finished Product delivered pursuant to Section 3.2, Alkermes' written certificate of analysis and certificate of compliance, certifying that the Finished Form or Finished Product included in such delivery complies with the Specifications. No later than sixtyfive (65) days after Genentech's or Genentech's Distributor's receipt of delivered Finished Product or Finished Form, as the case may be, Genentech or Genentech's Distributor will test the Finished Product or Finished Form, as the case may be, and will notify Alkermes of any claim that any such Finished Product or Finished Form, as the case may be, does not conform with the Specifications or the purchase order. Such notice shall be in 8 9 THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH "*" AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. writing and shall indicate the nonconforming characteristics of the Finished Form or Finished Product, as the case may be. If Genentech or Genentech's Distributor does not notify Alkermes of nonconformity within such sixtyfive (65)day period, such Finished Form or Finished Product shall be deemed accepted and Alkermes shall be released from any claim of nonconformity. If Genentech or Genentech's Distributor does notify Alkermes of nonconformity within such sixtyfive (65)day period, the appropriate personnel at the Parties shall in good faith investigate and attempt to resolve such nonconformity for a period of sixtyfive (65) days. In the event that Genentech or Genentech's Distributor claim that the Finished Form or Finished Product has not met the Specifications and Alkermes does not agree after such sixtyfive (65)day period, the Parties will mutually agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) upon a third party to review records, test data and other relevant information and ascertain responsibility. Such third party shall execute an appropriate Confidentiality Agreement approved in form and substance by Alkermes and Genentech. The third party's findings will be binding on both Parties, and the costs of such thirdparty testing and review will be borne by the Party found responsible. 4.2 DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR NONCONFORMING FINISHED FORM OR FINISHED PRODUCT. Alkermes will be responsible for nonconforming Finished Form or Finished Product on account of Alkermes' breach of its obligations in Section 3.4 (and Section 2.1(a) only with regard to Alkermes obligation to perform Processing). Genentech will be responsible for nonconforming Finished Form or Finished Product on account of Genentech's breach of its obligations in Sections 2.1(b) or 3.4. If the Parties, after good faith negotiation, cannot agree that the Finished Form or Finished Product is nonconforming (for example, there is disagreement whether it was produced in accordance with applicable SOPs or cGMPs) or upon which Party is responsible for nonconforming Finished Form, Finished Product or Lost Finished Product (as defined below), the Parties will mutually agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) upon a third party to review records, test data and other relevant information and ascertain conformity and/or responsibility. Such third party shall execute an appropriate Confidentiality Agreement approved in form and substance by Alkermes and Genentech. The third party's findings will be binding on both Parties, and the costs of such thirdparty testing and review will be borne by the Party found responsible. 4.3 LOST FINISHED FORM AND FINISHED PRODUCT. For purposes of this Agreement and subject to SECTION 8.2, Finished Form and Finished Product is considered lost if the Processing of Bulk Product is not performed for any reason (including, without limitation, due to the ruin, destruction or expiration of such Bulk Product, but not including instances where Alkermes is excused from making changes to a purchase order under Section 3.2), or if Bulk Product is actually Processed into Finished Form or Finished Product but such Finished Form or Finished Product is determined to be nonconforming under SECTION 4.1 or SECTION 4.2 (in each case, "LOST FINISHED PRODUCT"); provided, however, that Lost Finished Product will not include Finished Form or Finished Product determined to be nonconforming for any reason other than as set forth in SECTION 4.2. If any Lost Finished Product occurs for any reason, Alkermes will Process an amount of Finished Form or Finished Product, as the case may be, equivalent to the amount of Lost Finished Product, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to do so on whatever timing basis (regular or priority) is necessary to continue to meet Genentech's or Genentech's 9 10 THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH "*" AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. Distributor's supply requirements under the Processing Plan. Responsibility for Lost Finished Product shall be determined as follows: (a) ALKERMES. Alkermes shall be considered "responsible" for causing Lost Finished Product in the following situations: (i) Alkermes fails to provide Alkermes Materials in compliance with SECTION 2.1(a) or otherwise fails to take all necessary steps to Process as required under this Agreement (including the Specifications); (ii) Alkermes delays or fails to perform Processing altogether (e.g., due to the ruin or destruction of Bulk Product), unless SECTION 4.3(b)(i) applies (in which case Genentech is responsible) or unless SECTION 8.2 applies; or (iii) Alkermes is found responsible for nonconforming Finished Product under SECTIONS 4.1 AND 4.2. With regard to Lost Finished Product for which Alkermes is responsible, Genentech shall owe Alkermes for Processing Fees for the replacement Processing, but Genentech shall not owe Alkermes Processing Fees for the Lost Finished Product. [***] (b) GENENTECH. Genentech shall be considered "responsible" for causing Lost Finished Product in the following situations: (i) Genentech fails to provide Genentech Materials in compliance with SECTION 2.1(b); (ii) Genentech submits a change order reducing or increasing Processing without providing a change order at least thirty (30) days in advance as required under SECTION 3.2, unless SECTION 4.3(a)(i) applies (in which case Alkermes is responsible), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Alkermes has used reasonable efforts to accommodate such change order and is unable to do so; or (iii) Genentech is found responsible for nonconforming Finished Product under SECTIONS 4.1 AND 4.2. With regard to Lost Finished Product for which Genentech is responsible, Genentech shall pay Alkermes for the Processing Fees owed for the replacement Processing, as well as for Lost Finished Product actually Processed by Alkermes. With respect to any Finished Form or Finished Product (including any portion of a Batch Processed) that does not come under the definition of "Lost Finished Product" or no one is found to be "responsible" under this SECTION 4.3, this SECTION 4.3 will not apply and the other terms of this Agreement (including, for example, SECTION 6 regarding payment for Processing) will govern such Finished Form or Finished Product. SECTION 5: DELIVERIES; TITLE 5.1 DELIVERY. Upon completion of Processing and such testing as is necessary to complete a certificate of analysis and certificate of compliance, Alkermes will deliver Finished Product and/or Finished Form in accordance with the applicable purchase order, FOB Alkermes' loading dock. As long as the amount of Finished Form or Finished Product delivered is within +/ 5% of the amount ordered in the purchase order (and the difference is less than [***]) and the delivery is within +/ 5 business days of the requested delivery date, Alkermes shall be in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, the Processing Plan and the purchase orders. If Alkermes is unable to deliver Finished Form or Finished Product to Genentech within +/ 5 business days of the requested delivery date due to delay caused by Genentech in signing the batch record, Alkermes shall not be in breach of its obligations under this paragraph. Alkermes shall invoice Genentech for any applicable Processing Fees concurrent with shipment, and Genentech shall pay such Processing Fees, in accordance with SECTION 6. Alkermes will 10 11 THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH "*" AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. provide shipment preparation and packaging of Finished Product and/or Finished Form in Packaging Materials in accordance with the Specifications. In order to meet the delivery requirements under the Processing Plans and purchase orders, the Parties will agree within six (6) months of the Effective Date to the amounts of safety stock of Bulk Intermediates and Finished Form to be held at the Facility, based on the Parties' experience with Processing Bulk Product into Finished Form. From the Effective Date until the Parties have reached the agreement contemplated by the previous sentence, the amount of safety stock to be held will be (i) the number of grams of Bulk Intermediates necessary to support [***] of projected sales, and (ii) the number of Dosage Containers of Finished Form necessary to support [***] of projected sales. 5.2 TITLE; RISK OF LOSS. All Genentech Materials and Genentech Equipment in the custody of Alkermes will be and remain the exclusive property of Genentech at all times, and Genentech will own any domestic or foreign governmental rights, registrations or licenses associated with Bulk Product, Finished Form or Finished Product. Alkermes specifically waives any and all liens or security interests that it might acquire (whether by operation of law or otherwise) with respect to any property of Genentech. Alkermes' care, custody, control and use of any property of Genentech is determined solely by the terms of this Agreement, and Alkermes will never have the power of sale or disposal over any of it except with the express prior written consent of Genentech. SECTION 6: PRICING AND PAYMENT 6.1 PROCESSING FEES. Subject to the express terms of Section 4, in consideration for Processing and performing the other obligations of this Agreement, Genentech will pay to Alkermes the processing fees described in this SECTION 6.1. The processing fee ("Processing Fee") shall equal a fee per dosage form of [***] of the Net Sales Price per dosage form (or similar quantity) shipped to Genentech and Genentech's Distributors. In the event Alkermes is supplying Finished Form or Finished Product and opts to supply the other, Alkermes shall give written notice to Genentech at least 180 days prior to such change or such shorter period as the Parties agree upon in writing. In the event that Alkermes supplies only Finished Form, Genentech shall be entitled to deduct its or Genentech's Distributors' Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs of Processing Finished Form into Finished Product from the amount otherwise payable to Alkermes. The Processing Fee shall be determined as follows: (a) FORECASTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE NET SALES PRICE. The Processing Fee per vial of the Finished Form or Finished Product to be invoiced by Alkermes during a calendar year (or such portion of the first calendar year that the Licensed Product is commercially launched) shall be calculated as [***] of the estimated weighted average price per dosage form offered (or forecasted to be offered) by Genentech and Genentech's Distributors in arm's length sales to independent third parties for the Finished Product. Such weighted average price will be calculated based on the forecasted Net Sales Price of the Finished Product in each dosage form (expressed in USD in accordance with the License Agreement) in each country where Genentech and Genentech's Distributors intend to sell the Finished Product in such dosage form. 11 12 THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN REDACTED AND IS THE SUBJECT OF A CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST. REDACTED MATERIAL IS MARKED WITH "*" AND HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. (b) CHANGES IN NET SALES PRICE. Promptly upon increasing or decreasing the Net Sales Price of a particular dosage form by greater than [***], Genentech shall notify Alkermes of the then current Net Sales Price or forecasted Net Sales Price, as the case may be, and the weighted average price per dosage shall be recalculated for purposes of calculating the Processing Fee to be charged in each invoice. (c) YEAR END RECONCILIATION. In the month of [***] following each calendar year, adjustment shall be made if there is deviation between the estimated weighted average Net Sales Price per dosage form and the actual weighted average Net Sales Price of the Finished Product per dosage form (expressed in USD in accordance with the License Agreement). Any corrective payment to be made resulting from such reconciliation will be paid by the party owing such a payment within [***] after such reconciliation. 6.2 PAYMENT. Alkermes will invoice Genentech for any Processing Fee applicable to Finished Form or Finished Product on the date Alkermes delivers the Finished Form or Finished Product to which the invoice corresponds as set forth in SECTION 5.1, and Processing Fees will be due and payable net [***] after Genentech's receipt of Alkermes' invoice therefor.
