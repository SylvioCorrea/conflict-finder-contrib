This means, regardless of how good present performance is, it can become even better. "You can manage what you can measure." Align what you measure to the individual behaviors you want to support. 4.2 SUPPLIER PARTICIPATION 4.2.1 Contract manufacturing and other key suppliers are expected to [*] in the Brocade product development process. We depend on your [*] to optimize the design, quality, cost and delivery of Brocade products. Brocade will formally engage suppliers, through meetings and dialogue, throughout the product life cycle. Appendix A outlines a generic product qualification process flow. 4.3 MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION 4.3.1 Our goal is to create a communication process to establish and sustain mutually profitable and rewarding business relationships. We want to become your [*], and we want you to become our [*]. 4.3.2 To this end, Brocade will participate in periodic management communication meetings with key suppliers. These meetings will include a review of quality, cost and delivery performance metrics and ongoing improvement plans. 4.3.3 Specific Quality metrics and requirements are identified with in the Brocade Product Quality Plan's. Additionally, process parameters and controls may be included within each plan. 4.4 WORKMANSHIP STANDARDS 4.4.1 Printed Wiring Boards shall meet the requirements of [*], latest revision, Class [*]. 4.4.2 Printed Circuit Assemblies shall meet the requirements of [*], latest revision, Class [*]. 4.4.3 [*] Requirements for Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies and HDBK001 (Handbook and guide to supplement [*] with amendment [*]). 4.4.4 [*]. Supplier specific workmanship standards should be identified and communicated to Brocade, Inc. prior to production. 4.4.5 Brocade Cosmetic Specification 95000000101. 4.5 REPAIR AND REWORK 4.5.1 [*] (Terms and Definitions for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic Circuits) contains the following definitions: Repair(ing): The act of restoring the functional capability of a defective article in a manner that precludes compliance with applicable drawings or specifications. Rework(ing): The act of reprocessing noncomplying articles, through the use of original or alternate equivalent processing, in order to bring the article into compliance with applicable drawings and specifications. 4.5.2 [*] (Suggested Guidelines for Modification, Rework and Repair of Printed Boards and Assemblies) categorizes modifications, rework and repairs into [*] levels ([*]). 4.5.3 Brocade will accept PWB fab and assemblies that have been [*]), using Level [*] techniques outlined in the above.

Brocade Communication Systems Inc. Document: 99000011201 Page 4 of 8 Revision: A Revision Date: 2/11/03 4.6.2 Suppliers are expected to initiate and/or participate in periodic value engineering efforts to reduce the current and future Brocade cost of goods sold (COGS). The timing and content of this activity shall be determined on a [*] basis. 4.7 AUTHORIZED VENDOR LIST (AVL) 4.7.1 Contract manufacturers and other partners who supply critical components to Brocade must use Brocade's AVL, as required. Notification of this requirement will be made in advance. 4.7.2 Brocade will consider AVL change recommendations from any supplier. Change requests must be approved in writing by Brocade prior to implementation. This is typically done through Brocade's Agile Document System. 4.7.3 Brocade reserves the right to [*] or [*] at no additional cost of any materials supplied with [*] content. This will be considered a serious offense and may have a negative impact on the offending supplier relationship with Brocade. 4.8 PROCESS QUALIFICATION & CONTROLS 4.8.1 Brocade may require certain documentation from selected suppliers prior to commencing production. 4.8.2 The following supporting documentation may be requested: Supplier qualification & performance monitoring process Production process flow diagram Product qualification testing plan and results (PVT) Supplier version of BOM's and AVL's used to produce Brocade products Process characterization documentation [e.g. SMT stencil, solder paste, SMT and throughhole reflow, board cleaning, rework, etc.] Production test specifications and instructions, and inprocess quality/control plan Assembly process flow diagram Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility Studies (Gage R&R: where/when applicable) First Article Inspection Other documentation as appropriate 4.9 TEST/QUALITY DATA COLLECTION & REPORTING 4.9.1 Suppliers will be required to provide periodic test and inspection yield information to Brocade, upon request.

Document: 99000011201 Page 5 of 8 Revision: A Revision Date: 2/11/03 4.10 PRODUCT INSPECTION / PROCESS AUDITING 4.10.1 Brocade reserves the right to conduct [*] product inspection and/or process audits of supplier facilities engaged in producing supplied parts or Brocade final products. These activities would be conducted with [*] of the respective supplier. Discrepancies found during these audits will result in a Corrective Action Request (CAR) (see Paragraph 4.12 below.) 4.10.2 Brocade also reserves the right to conduct source inspection at the supplier site. This inspection process, if implemented, would typically include the following activities: Inspection of in process and/or finished product against all appropriate workmanship standards. Acceptance sampling in accordance with ANSI Z1.4 (supercedes Mil Std 105), Single Sampling Plan for 1% AQL, Level II, normal inspection level. As an example, a random sample of 13 units would be inspected for critical workmanship attributes from a lot of 100 units. The lot would be accepted with zero defects found and rejected with one or more defects found. The supplier would be responsible to conduct a 100% screen of the entire lot for the defective attribute and resubmit the lot for another sample inspection. Reduced inspection would occur when production is at steady state, ten consecutive lots pass at normal inspection levels, and the total number of defects in the sample from those ten lots are equal to or less than the applicable number given in ANSI Z1.4. Acceptance of five additional lots at reduced level would qualify the part number for docktostock. Conversely, if two of five consecutive lots were rejected, a tightened inspection would be conducted until five consecutive lots were accepted. At that point, the part would start the qualification process over at the normal inspection level. 4.10.3 Details of the source inspection process and qualification standards will be further defined and agreed upon prior to implementation with selected suppliers. 4.11 RETURN MATERIAL AUTHORIZATION (RMA) PROCESSING 4.11.1 Brocade will contact suppliers with RMA requests via telephone, email and/or fax, depending upon the specific arrangements made. 4.11.2 Unless otherwise specified, suppliers shall provide RMA numbers to Brocade within [*] from receipt of the request. 4.11.3 Suppliers shall repair or replace the defective part within [*] of receipt of the defective product. 4.11.4 Suppliers shall maintain records of all RMA requests and provide inprocess and completion status of Brocade RMA's. 4.12 CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUESTS (CARS) 4.12.1 Brocade will issue a Corrective Action Request (Appendix B) whenever a discrepant product or unsatisfactory supplier process condition is discovered. The CAR Form may be transmitted to the supplier via email or fax. 4.12.2 Unless otherwise specified, suppliers shall acknowledge receipt and provide a preliminary assessment and immediate corrective action of the discrepancy within [*]) of receipt. Unless otherwise specified, the preventative measures shall be completed and the documentation submitted no later than [*] of a CAR receipt.
