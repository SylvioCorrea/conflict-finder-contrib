DOCUMENT OVERVIEW - HOW IS IT STRUCTURED?

The nature of this document: The Agreement contained in this document (once completed by the parties) records the Grant Agreement, including its purpose (see clause 2.1 and Schedule Part A [Purpose]).

Schedule and Clauses: The Agreement starts with the "Schedule", which describes the specific purpose, parties, services, payment details and standards applying to the Agreement in respect of an individual deal. 
The Schedule Parts precede the standard clauses (the "Clauses") for providing services to, or for, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).

The Schedule allows for the specific details to be entered that make the Clauses effective. 

Some Parts of the Schedule describe essential issues (eg, the Grant and Payment). Others enable the parties to cover optional issues (eg, financial incentives or IT connectivity). Some Schedule Parts relate to Clauses that spell out the Commonwealth's requirements (eg, ensuring access to records for auditors and protecting privacy).

Signatures Page and Agreement Date: The Signature Page is where the parties indicate assent to this Agreement (ie, that they entered this Agreement from the "Agreement Date").

Under Schedule Part D, the parties' obligations may be expressed to occur before the specific "Agreement Date".

Cross-referencing names: Cross-referencing from the provisions of the Schedule Parts and the Clauses of the Agreement include a shorthand description for ease of reference.  This style of cross-referencing is encouraged for use in drafting Schedule Parts.

  A 
On 7 November 1997, the Parties signed the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement with the objective of establishing a uniform national framework for third party access to natural gas pipelines.
  B 
Under the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement, the Parties agreed upon a uniform "Gas Pipelines Access Law", which included a "National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems".
  C 
In accordance with the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement, the State of South Australia passed the Gas Pipelines Access (South Australia) Act 1997, which applied the Gas Pipelines Access Law (comprising Schedule 1 (Third Party Access to Natural Gas Pipelines) and Schedule 2 (National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems (the Code)) as a law of South Australia.
  D 
In accordance with the Natural Gas Pipelines Access Agreement, each other Party (except the State of Western Australia) has passed application legislation applying the Gas Pipelines Access Law as set out in Schedules 1 and 2 to the Gas Pipelines Access (South Australia) Act 1997, as laws of that Party.  The State of Western Australia has enacted the Gas Pipelines Access (Western Australia) Act 1998, which has essentially identical effect to the Gas Pipelines Access (South Australia) Act 1997 and applies the Gas Pipelines Access Law as set out in Schedules to the Western Australian Act as law of the State of Western Australia.
  E 
Section 6 of Schedule 1 of the Gas Pipelines Access Law and section 9 of the Code establish a procedure whereby the Code may be amended.
  F 
On 15 March 2002, in accordance with section 9 of the Code and section 6(1) of Schedule 1 of the Gas Pipelines Access Law, the National Gas Pipelines Advisory Committee recommended to Relevant Ministers that an amendment be made to the Code.
  G

PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AGREEMENT

BETWEEN


SUPERVISING SURVEYOR

AND A

CANDIDATE REGISTERED WITH THE TASMANIAN LAND SURVEYORS ACCREDITATION BOARD








Tasmanian Land Surveyors Accreditation Board

Institution of Surveyors (Tasmanian Division)





PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AGREEMENT1

1.	PURPOSE

This agreement records the training programme to be undertaken by (_______________), a candidate registered with the Tasmanian Land Surveyors Accreditation Board (TLSAB), under the guidance of the supervising surveyor (________________).

The supervising surveyor and the candidate should review the relevant legislation and any guidelines published by the Tasmanian Land Surveyors Accreditation Board, particularly:
1. The Surveyors Act 2002.
2. The Surveyors Regulations 2003.
3. The TLSAB "Guidelines for Candidates Seeking a Certificate of Competency Leading to Registration Under the Surveyors Act 2002".

Successful completion of the training programme should fully prepare a candidate for examination by the TLSAB.

2.	THE SUPERVISING SURVEYOR

Describe the supervising surveyor by name, address and qualifications. Give a brief record of experience and appointments.  List membership of professional associations.

3.	THE CANDIDATE

Describe the candidate by name, address and qualifications. Make reference to any academic records and experience in surveying contained in attachments.

4.	THE COMPANY

Describe the company by listing principals, areas of operation, types of work undertaken, equipment and resources, and any particular opportunities or potential lack of opportunities for the candidate. 



5.	ESSENCE OF AGREEMENT


Note here if the Agreement applies to periods of experience that do not meet the normal minimum requirement specified in the Surveyors Regulations 2003







6.	CANDIDATE'S COMPETENCIES (INITIALLY)

Describe the competencies, experience and knowledge at the start of the training period here. If that is not practical, provide them on an attachment and refer to it at paragraph 3. This statement will assist the preparation of the training programme and its time schedule.



7.	SCOPE OF TRAINING

Append to the signed Agreement (as "Attachment A") section 5 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors, annotated if required to detail the training to be provided under this Agreement.



8 	LEVEL OF SUPERVISION

Append to the signed Agreement (as "Attachment B") section 6 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors, annotated as required to detail the level of supervision to be provided under this Agreement.

Strict supervision can only be relaxed as the candidate demonstrates that it is appropriate to do so. The candidate's development depends on a progressively reduced level of supervision.

9.	EXCLUSIONS

If the company does not carry out some types of work (or some components of work), or use some type of equipment, which are essential or desirable for the candidate's development, they should be itemised. The responsibility for attaining this experience should be allocated and if it is to be included within this training agreement the solution should be described. If the excluded training is to be achieved through another surveyor and company but within the ambit of this agreement, the responsibility of the supervising surveyor and the other surveyor should be set out.



10	TIME SCHEDULE 

It is recommended that the agreement include a time schedule targeting dates for achievement of each of the competencies described in a "Scope of Training" (see Appendix A for an example).  This will allow both parties to monitor progress of the training, correct any identified problems and to understand the magnitude of the task from the start. The candidate should participate in the preparation of the time schedule.   Attach the time schedule as Attachment C to the signed Agreement.



11	RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SUPERVISING SURVEYOR

The responsibilities of the supervising surveyor under this agreement are stated in section 7 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors.  Append a copy, annotated as required, as attachment D to the signed Agreement.


12.	RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CANDIDATE

The responsibilities of the candidate under this agreement are stated in section 8 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors.  Append a copy, annotated as required, as attachment E to the signed Agreement.


13	ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPUTATION

It is recognised that the candidate (during this agreement and after accreditation) is a reflection on the supervisor and on the company (in fieldnotes, project work and direct relations with the client and the public). The candidate's training is at least as important to the supervisor as the successful completion of survey jobs. The supervisor and company will provide every possible tuition, guidance and opportunity, but the candidate will only be progressed to the next stage when ability is proven.

Despite any intention of the candidate to specialise once accredited by the Board, this training must give a balanced general training in all aspects of cadastral work. Competency in all aspects must be demonstrated before the candidate should be recommended as competent to present for examination.

14.	TRAINING REPORTS

The candidate and the supervising surveyor will maintain the records required by section 9 of the Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors and will submit training reports to the Board as required.




15.		CERTIFICATION

We the abovenamed certify our acceptance of this professional training agreement.

DRAFT NUMBER 11.1.1998Guidelines for Supervising Surveyors

1.	Introduction1.INTRODUCTION

These guidelines are to inform supervising surveyors of their obligations and responsibilities in the training of candidates under a Professional Training Agreement.

Professional Training Agreements are taken very seriously by the Board.  Although the Board conducts final examinations of candidates prior to granting Certificates of Competency, it can only ever be a general indication of the competence of the candidates.  The real tests occur during the life of the Professional Training Agreement where the level of knowledge and character necessary to become a professional surveyor is determined by the supervising surveyor.  It is only when a candidate has achieved that standard in the mind of the supervisor that approval should be given for the candidate to present to the Board in the final examinations.  Poorly presented candidates reflect on the reputation of the supervising surveyor.

During the training agreement and after registration, the graduate surveyor is a reflection of the supervisor and on the company.  The supervisor and company should provide every possible tuition, guidance and opportunity and the candidate should only be progressed to the next stage when ability is proven.

Despite any intention of the candidate to specialise once registered, the training must give a balanced general training in all aspects of cadastral work.  Competency in all aspects must be demonstrated before the candidate is recommended for the examination.

These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the Surveyors Act 2002, the Surveyors Regulations 2003 and the Board's "Guidelines for Candidates Seeking a Certificate of Competency Leading to Registration Under the Surveyors Act 2002".



2.	Definitions2.DEFINITIONS

In these guidelines the following expressions have the following meanings:

?  "Board" means the Tasmanian Land Surveyors Accreditation Board.

? "Candidate" means a undergraduate or graduate surveyor who is a party to a Professional Training Agreement.

? "Supervising Surveyor" or "Supervisor" means a registered land surveyor who agrees to supervise a candidate under a Professional Training Agreement.



3.	The Professional Training Agreement3.THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AGREEMENT

The purpose of the professional training agreement (PTA) is to provide the candidate with a structured training program of education and professional development.  The PTA should be structured so as to enable the candidate to progress to the level of a competent professional surveyor in an efficient and effective manner.  The PTA should take into account local conditions and specialisations.  It should be prepared by the supervising surveyor in consultation with the candidate.



4.	Competency Standards4.COMPETENCY STANDARDS

The Institution of Surveyors Australia Incorporated (ISA) in conjunction with the Reciprocating Surveyors' Boards of Australia and New Zealand has developed "National Competency Standards for Professional Surveyors".  While those standards (published in July 1996) do not specifically deal with cadastral surveys, these guidelines are based on those general standards.

In particular, pages 51 through 66 of those National Competency Standards detail the necessary "Key Competencies" for stage 2 (equivalent to the period of a professional training agreement).

Supervisors are to ensure that candidates achieve the level of competency and professional development required by the Board as outlined herein and in the competency based standards for surveyors.  Candidates should be exposed to a variety of surveys and challenged by difficult and complex situations.  Supervisors are to ensure that any deficiencies in the candidate's skills are rectified.

The training should be broadly based, not specialised.  The training subjects that should be covered are detailed in guideline 5.  Some require full competence while others only require an awareness.

Two topics deserve special mention as they are vital to the ultimate professionalism of every surveyor-

? Professional ethics should be impressed on the candidate both by example and by instruction throughout the period of the PTA; and

? Leadership is a quality necessary to all surveyors.


5.	Skills and knowledge to be demonstrated5.SKILLS TO BE TAUGHT

In transforming the generic competencies to the specific cadastral area, the candidate should demonstrate the following competencies and, where appropriate, receive such training as is needed to acquire these competencies:

AGREEMENT

 BETWEEN

THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES OF 

THE STATES AND TERRITORIES OF AUSTRALIA

AND 

THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION

AND

THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

AND

THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
for the purposes of this Agreement represented by the

AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS

AND

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND AGEING

AND

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS' AFFAIRS


 (2004 to 2009)

Concerning the establishment of structures and processes through which the Commonwealth, State and Territory health and statistical authorities will develop agreed programs to improve, maintain and share national health information.



1.	PREAMBLE

The planning and provision of health services and health programs are important and complex undertakings in which governments, government instrumentalities, private organisations, health professionals, academics, community groups and individuals have shared responsibilities.

The national health system operates within finite resources that cannot be expected to increase significantly in real terms.  The system is required to meet increasing demands and changing needs and is experiencing major technological advances.  Health and statistical authorities are committed to micro economic and structural reform and to being responsible and accountable for their expenditure and impact.

Information is required about health services and health service consumers; and about environmental and human factors that may affect health.  To ensure that essential, accurate, reliable and timely information is available nationwide for and about the health system a coordinated approach and agreed rules are needed to facilitate jurisdictional cooperation, efficient and effective utilisation of financial and intellectual resources.

Health service information is generated by health professionals, health administrators and government agencies in the conduct of their normal activities.  Consistent with sound management and commercial practice and protection of individual privacy, the use of this information should be optimised.  Collections should be rationalised to eliminate duplication and minimise the need for special collections.
 
The framework provided by this Agreement should also assist, where appropriate, consistency between health, community services and housing assistance information.

As governments provide or finance almost 70% of all health services, and largely fund the training of health professionals, they are major producers and users of health information.  Therefore, the Agreement will cover government authorities initially but efforts will be made to involve other sectors in the processes and possibly in the Agreement itself.

This Agreement is to ensure that the collection, compilation and interpretation of national information are appropriate and are carried out efficiently.  This will require agreement on definitions, standards and rules of collection of information and on guidelines for the co-ordination of access, interpretation and publication of national health information.

This Agreement retains the main features and scope of the Agreement developed in 1993 and incorporates amendments to reflect the significant changes to health information governance introduced in 2003 and the increased emphasis on consistency in data standards between health, community services and housing assistance. It also includes the Commonwealth Department of Veterans' Affairs as a signatory.  

The Agreement provides for the addition of schedules to the Agreement to cater for specific requirements, where agreed by relevant parties or to provide more detail on specific matters.

The Australian community will be the beneficiaries of this Agreement as the result of better and more timely information, more appropriate provision of services, improved health outcomes and improved efficiency. 

For the purposes of this Agreement, 'health information' is data or derived information, or indices, recorded or published in any medium, including data concerned with:

	the health status and risks of individuals and populations; and

	the provision of health and illness care services, health promotion and disease prevention programs including  information on the uses, costs and outcomes of services and programs, and the resources required to provide the services and programs.

Health information has multiple purposes, including clinical purposes, administrative purposes and statistical purposes.  However, the main focus of this Agreement covers health information used for analytical, statistical and research purposes. 

2.	AIM AND OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Agreement is to ensure the availability of nationally consistent quality health and health services data to support important policy and program development, and improvements in the quality, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of health services provided to individuals or populations. 

Nationally consistent health information also supports public discussion of health matters and research by health researchers and health professionals. The overarching aim is to improve the health of all Australians by contributing to better planning and practice in health promotion and prevention and the prevention, detection and treatment of diseases and injury.

The aim of this Agreement is to improve access by governments, health professionals, non-government organisations and community groups to uniform health information.

  Specifically, the objectives are to:

	promote the collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of relevant, timely, accurate and reliable health information concerned with the full range of health services and of a range of population parameters (including health status and risks), in accordance with nationally agreed protocols and standards;

	develop and agree on projects to improve, maintain and share national health information;

	cooperate in the provision of resources necessary to address national health information development priorities efficiently and effectively;

	provide the information required to research, monitor and improve health and the delivery of health services;

	provide the information required to facilitate nationally agreed projects which promote the development and reform of the health care system in accordance with the priorities of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council; 

	promote the extension of the range of national health information and encourage other groups and individuals in government and non-government sectors to participate by making available information that they hold; and 

	work towards improving consistency in data definitions, classifications and collections between health, community services and housing assistance. 

3.	CONTEXT 


This section describes the context and underlying principles within which the Agreement will operate.

3.1	Collection of National Health Information:

4.	OPERATION OF THE AGREEMENT

7	SCHEDULES TO THE AGREEMENT

This Agreement provides for the addition of Schedules which are consistent with the scope and purpose of the Agreement.  Schedules will deal with more specific matters, such as the details of the committees responsible for specific aspects of management and operation of the Agreement or program based or specific purpose information structures agreed by parties during the life of the Agreement. Any schedules to the Agreement will specify the relationship between the matters in the schedule and the relevant sections of the Agreement.



8	DATE OF COMMENCEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT.

A series of national committees has been established to manage this Agreement and undertake specific tasks associated with the development and maintenance of national health information.  The key responsibilities of these committees in relation to this Agreement and related matters are set out in this Schedule. Some responsibilities which do not relate closely to this Agreement may not be listed. 


The NHIG has responsibility for providing AHMAC with strategic advice on national health information and for advising AHMAC on:
 national priorities for health information; and
* planning and management requirements for national health information, including funding requirements.

NAGATSIHID membership comprises representatives of the ABS, the AIHW, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing; a National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Service; Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, the SCATSIH and the SIMC as well as Indigenous experts on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and welfare and an epidemiologist with expertise in Indigenous health issues.

The National Public Health Information Working Group (NPHIWG)

The National Public Health Information Working Group (NPHIWG) is a sub-committee of the National Public Health Partnership (NPHP) and the National Health Information Group (NHIG). It advises and reports to the NPHP and the NHIG on:
* national public health information issues, including the development and implementation of the National Public Health Information Plan;
* collection, dissemination and analysis of national public health information; and 
* harmonisation and collaboration between jurisdictions in relation to public health information.

Membership includes representatives of the Australian Government (including the Australian Bureau of Statistics) and State and Territory government health departments, and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

Secretariat

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) provides secretariat assistance to the SIMC, the HDSC, the NAGATSIHID and the NPHIWG and support to the chairs of those Committees.
