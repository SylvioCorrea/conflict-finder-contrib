Version 2
          
Notes
1.	This form is prepared for the purpose of section 175B of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, Schedule 2 Part 5 Payroll Tax Act 2007 and section 127 of the Industrial Relation Act 1996.  If this form is completed in accordance with these provisions, a principal contractor is relieved of liability for workers compensation premiums, payroll tax and remuneration payable by the subcontractor.
A principal contractor can be generally defined to include any person who has entered into a contract for the carrying out of work by another person (or other legal entity called the subcontractor) and where employees of the subcontractor are engaged in carrying out the work which is in connection with the principal contractor's business.
2.	For the purpose of this Subcontractor's Statement, a principal contractor is a person (or other legal entity), who has entered into a contract with another person (or other legal entity) referred to as the subcontractor, and employees/workers of that subcontractor will perform the work under contract.  The work must be connected to the business undertaking of the principal contractor.
3.	Provide the unique contract number, title, or other information that identifies the contract.
4.	In order to meet the requirements of s127 Industrial Relations Act 1996, a statement in relation to remuneration must state the period to which the statement relates.  For sequential Statements ensure that the dates provide continuous coverage.
Section 127(6) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 defines remuneration 'as remuneration or other amounts payable to relevant employees by legislation, or under an industrial instrument, in connection with work done by the employees.'
Section 127(11) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 states 'to avoid doubt, this section extends to a principal contractor who is the owner or occupier of a building for the carrying out of work in connection with the building so long as the building is owned or occupied by the principal contractor in connection with a business undertaking of the principal contractor.'
5.	Provide the date of the most recent payment claim.
6.	For Workers Compensation purposes an exempt employer is an employer who pays less than $7500 annually, who does not employ an apprentice or trainee and is not a member of a group.
7.	In completing the Subcontractor's Statement, a subcontractor declares that workers compensation insurance premiums payable up to and including the date(s) on the Statement have been paid, and all premiums owing during the term of the contract will be paid.
8.	In completing the Subcontractor's Statement, a subcontractor declares that all remuneration payable to relevant employees for work under the contract has been paid.
9.	In completing the Subcontractor's Statement, a subcontractor declares that all payroll tax payable relating to the work undertaken has been paid.
10.	It is important to note that a business could be both a subcontractor and a principal contractor, if a business 'in turn' engages subcontractors to carry out the work.  If your business engages a subcontractor you are to also obtain Subcontractor's Statements from your subcontractors.
Statement Retention
The principal contractor receiving a Subcontractor's Statement must keep a copy of the Statement for the periods stated in the respective legislation.  This is currently up to seven years.

Offences in respect of a false Statement
In terms of s127(8) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996, a person who gives the principal contractor a written statement knowing it to be false is guilty of an offence if:
(a)	the person is the subcontractor;
(b)	the person is authorised by the subcontractor to give the statement on behalf of the subcontractor; or
(c)	the person holds out or represents that the person is authorised by the subcontractor to give the statement on behalf of the subcontractor.
In terms of s175B of the Workers Compensation Act and clause 18 of Schedule 2 of the Payroll Tax Act 2007 a person who gives the principal contractor a written statement knowing it to be false is guilty of an offence.Further Information
