WHEREAS

A.	The Contributor at the request of the Manager has agreed from time to time in its discretion to provide the Custodian with copies of the Contributor's privately funded airborne geophysical datasets ("AGS Datasets") to assist in the establishment of a centralised airborne geophysical database ("MAGNet Database") to be accessible to purchasers under the terms and conditions (including the price) set forth in this Agreement.

B.	The Manager at the request of the Custodian and with the knowledge and agreement of the Contributor shall be responsible for the establishment of MAGNet Database and the ongoing management of the MAGNet Database and the Manager will take all reasonable steps to gather other available privately-funded airborne geophysical data for inclusion in the MAGNet Database and to re-process, compile, catalogue and display as images and maps all such data and to make reprocessed data available for sale and to prepare a comprehensive description of each data set.

C.	The Contributor, the Custodian and the Manager all acknowledge that the AGS Datasets will be held by the Custodian in trust for the Contributor but subject always to the terms of this Agreement.

	At any time, from time to time, after the date of this Agreement, the Contributor may provide the Custodian with the AGS Datasets.  The data delivery shall conform where possible to the specification outlined in Attachment 3.  Contribution of the survey data will be on a voluntary, survey-by-survey basis, and may at the discretion of the Contributor include currently confidential data.  All survey data delivered to the Custodian will be accompanied by a statement of ownership in the form set out in Attachment 4.

1.2	Inclusion of AGS Datasets

DATA PROCESSING, PRESENTATION AND MANAGEMENT

The Manager shall perform the following tasks on the multi-client datasets incorporated into the MAGNet Database.

(a)	Data collection
	Receive data, catalogue and send acknowledgment of receipt of the survey data to the contributor company

(b)	Data validation
	Review survey quality and document work programme

(c)	Data re-processing
	Review data correction and levelling for aeromagnetic surveys and re-process aeromagnetic data where beneficial.

(d)	Data organisation
	Generate a graphical index to all survey contributed by Contributors and incorporated into the MAGNet Database.

(e)	Data presentation
	Generate a series of standard grid products and a flight-line diagram for each incorporated survey at a nominated resolution.  These standard products shall be included in the purchase price of the data.

	These products shall be specific to each survey and shall include:

	GRIDDED DATA
	for aeromagnetic data,



.	TMI grid and for radiometric data (where supplied),
.	Total Count grid, K grid, U grid, and Th grid

	The default grid format is to be BIL (Band Interleaved by Line), with a header for ER-Mapper.

	Any further products required from the data, including digital grids, images and maps, will be charged at normal commercial rates for these products.

(f)	Data archive

	The final processed data will be stored on CD-ROM.  Two copies will be made and one copy will be stored off-site in a secure facility.  The physical storing of the data shall be determined from time to time by the Custodian in connection with the Manager and each contribution to the MAGNet Database

(g)	Quality/Quality Control

	Issues of data quality relate to the original acquisition and processing of the survey, and are not the responsibility of the Manager.

	A QA system will be devised to ensure data deliveries conform to industry standards, and to an agreed flat ASCII format.

	No liability for data errors will be accepted by the database managers.  Purchasers of the data will sign a licence agreement to this effect at the time of sale.

_____________________________________________________________________


The above price structure is indicative only. It includes provision of located and gridded data, but does not include any provision of value-added map products, etc.  These may be ordered at normal commercial rates.
Where it can be demonstrated that the above prices are inappropriate (for example because of poor recovery techniques) the sale price may be varied, but only with the approval of the contributor.

Rates for supply of EM data will depend on a range of factors including ownership, data volumes and type of survey.  It is noted that current prices for new EM surveys range from $55/km to $70/km.

*	These rates assume re-processing work to be funded by the manager
*	Statistical Noise Reduction for 256-channel radiometrics negotiated on request

2.	Royalties will be payable on a quarterly basis, with payments being due on or before 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December.  A statement of data sold from the scheme, cross-referenced to survey details, will be issued quarterly on the 31st March, 30th June, 30 September and 31st December.  

3.	No entry fees or up-front payments are required from any purchaser.

4.	The Manager will engage the services of:-
