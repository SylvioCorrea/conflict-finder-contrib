 BETWEEN

THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES OF 

THE STATES AND TERRITORIES OF AUSTRALIA

AND 

THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION

AND

THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

AND

THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
for the purposes of this Agreement represented by the

AND

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS' AFFAIRS


 (2004 to 2009)

Concerning the establishment of structures and processes through which the Commonwealth, State and Territory health and statistical authorities will develop agreed programs to improve, maintain and share national health information.



1.	PREAMBLE

The planning and provision of health services and health programs are important and complex undertakings in which governments, government instrumentalities, private organisations, health professionals, academics, community groups and individuals have shared responsibilities.

The national health system operates within finite resources that cannot be expected to increase significantly in real terms.  The system is required to meet increasing demands and changing needs and is experiencing major technological advances.  Health and statistical authorities are committed to micro economic and structural reform and to being responsible and accountable for their expenditure and impact.

Information is required about health services and health service consumers; and about environmental and human factors that may affect health.  To ensure that essential, accurate, reliable and timely information is available nationwide for and about the health system a coordinated approach and agreed rules are needed to facilitate jurisdictional cooperation, efficient and effective utilisation of financial and intellectual resources.

Health service information is generated by health professionals, health administrators and government agencies in the conduct of their normal activities.  Consistent with sound management and commercial practice and protection of individual privacy, the use of this information should be optimised.  Collections should be rationalised to eliminate duplication and minimise the need for special collections.
 
The framework provided by this Agreement should also assist, where appropriate, consistency between health, community services and housing assistance information.

As governments provide or finance almost 70% of all health services, and largely fund the training of health professionals, they are major producers and users of health information.  Therefore, the Agreement will cover government authorities initially but efforts will be made to involve other sectors in the processes and possibly in the Agreement itself.

This Agreement is to ensure that the collection, compilation and interpretation of national information are appropriate and are carried out efficiently.  This will require agreement on definitions, standards and rules of collection of information and on guidelines for the co-ordination of access, interpretation and publication of national health information.

This Agreement retains the main features and scope of the Agreement developed in 1993 and incorporates amendments to reflect the significant changes to health information governance introduced in 2003 and the increased emphasis on consistency in data standards between health, community services and housing assistance. It also includes the Commonwealth Department of Veterans' Affairs as a signatory.  

The Agreement provides for the addition of schedules to the Agreement to cater for specific requirements, where agreed by relevant parties or to provide more detail on specific matters.

The Australian community will be the beneficiaries of this Agreement as the result of better and more timely information, more appropriate provision of services, improved health outcomes and improved efficiency. 

For the purposes of this Agreement, 'health information' is data or derived information, or indices, recorded or published in any medium, including data concerned with:

•	the health status and risks of individuals and populations; and

•	the provision of health and illness care services, health promotion and disease prevention programs including  information on the uses, costs and outcomes of services and programs, and the resources required to provide the services and programs.

Health information has multiple purposes, including clinical purposes, administrative purposes and statistical purposes.  However, the main focus of this Agreement covers health information used for analytical, statistical and research purposes. 

2.	AIM AND OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this Agreement is to ensure the availability of nationally consistent quality health and health services data to support important policy and program development, and improvements in the quality, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of health services provided to individuals or populations. 

Nationally consistent health information also supports public discussion of health matters and research by health researchers and health professionals. The overarching aim is to improve the health of all Australians by contributing to better planning and practice in health promotion and prevention and the prevention, detection and treatment of diseases and injury.

The aim of this Agreement is to improve access by governments, health professionals, non-government organisations and community groups to uniform health information.

  Specifically, the objectives are to:

•	promote the collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of relevant, timely, accurate and reliable health information concerned with the full range of health services and of a range of population parameters (including health status and risks), in accordance with nationally agreed protocols and standards;

•	develop and agree on projects to improve, maintain and share national health information;

•	cooperate in the provision of resources necessary to address national health information development priorities efficiently and effectively;

•	provide the information required to research, monitor and improve health and the delivery of health services;

•	provide the information required to facilitate nationally agreed projects which promote the development and reform of the health care system in accordance with the priorities of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council; 

•	promote the extension of the range of national health information and encourage other groups and individuals in government and non-government sectors to participate by making available information that they hold; and 

•	work towards improving consistency in data definitions, classifications and collections between health, community services and housing assistance. 

3.	CONTEXT 

This section describes the context and underlying principles within which the Agreement will operate.

3.1	Collection of National Health Information:

3.1.1	Health information under this Agreement will be gathered and maintained nationally with the approval of the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, and within the framework of the national health information governance arrangements outlined in Clause 5 of, and Schedule A to, this Agreement.

3.1.2	National collections will use data from surveys of the Australian population as well as data contributed by the Parties, their agents or by other parties.  The level of data contributed to national collections, being at an appropriate level of aggregation or unit record, will be agreed for each collection.

3.1.6	Any such business case must accommodate, where appropriate, other national data imperatives of reporting requirements such as the Australian Health Care Agreements (AHCAs).

3.2	Rights and Privileges:

3.2.1	Unless in the public domain, data provided by a Party remains the sole property of that individual Party and therefore release, publication or other use of the data by any other party or group will be within any arrangements set by the providing party.

3.2.2	When publishing or releasing any national health information each Party shall acknowledge the authorship as advised by the provider of the data.

3.2.3	Users of the information will be expected to respect the custodial role and ownership rights of collecting parties and no Party shall be obliged to supply any information or to identify its origin if by so doing it would jeopardise that Party's continuing access to the information.

3.2.4	All information contributed by Parties to this Agreement will be provided in good faith as to its accuracy and any legal or other liability arising from the use of any information supplied to national collections shall be the responsibility of the publishing Party.

3.3	Access to National Health Information:

4.4	Privacy: 

4.4.1	Even though this Agreement is about health information rather than personal health information, policies and practices which protect the privacy of individual's information and ensure the responsible handling of health information will provide the foundation for the information collected and published under the auspices of this Agreement. Information will be collected, disseminated, secured and used in such a way as to protect the privacy and confidentiality of any individual and/or organisation to whom it may refer.  In particular, all State/Territory and Commonwealth of Australia legislation and policies including privacy/confidentiality arrangements and requirements and established ethical guidelines and practices; and freedom of information legislation and policy will be complied with in any formal or informal arrangements made under this Agreement.

4.4.2	All parties will respect the rights to privacy and confidentiality requirements of any person or organisation named or otherwise identified in any information resource.
