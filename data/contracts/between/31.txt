          PARTIES
This Deed is made between and binds the following parties:

          CONTEXT AND PURPOSE
This Deed is made in the following context:
A. The Convention on Biological Diversity and the Bonn Guidelines under it give parties to the Convention the responsibility to manage their biological diversity to ensure, inter alia, fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.
B. Section 301 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) provides for regulations to be made for the control of access to biological resources in Commonwealth areas, including the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of biological resources in Commonwealth areas. 
C. Part 8A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000 (EPBC Regulations) makes provisions for the purposes of section 301 of the EPBC Act.  The regulations require access to biological resources in a Commonwealth area to be in accordance with a permit under the regulations unless the biological resources have been declared exempt.  An applicant for a permit to access biological resources for commercial purposes or potential commercial must enter into a benefit-sharing agreement with each access provider for the resources.
D. The Commonwealth is the access provider for the purposes of Part 8A of the EPBC Regulations for biological resources in Commonwealth areas (as defined in the EPBC Act).
E. The Access Party is the applicant for, or intends to apply for, a permit under Part 8A of the EPBC Regulations to access the biological resources, in the Commonwealth area or areas, specified in Schedule 2 to this Deed.
F. This Deed constitutes a Benefit Sharing Agreement for the purposes of Part 8A of the EPBC Regulations.
G. In consideration of the Access Party entering into this Deed the Commonwealth grants the Access Party access to the biological resources, in the Commonwealth area or areas, specified in Schedule 2.
H. In consideration of the Commonwealth granting access the Access Party will access and use the biological resources in accordance with this Deed and will provide the Commonwealth with the benefits specified in Schedules 3 and 4 to this Deed.
I. This Deed, in conjunction with an access permit issued under Part 8A of the EPBC Regulations, gives the Access Party access to biological resources in the Access Area.
