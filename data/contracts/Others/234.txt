2.	NATURE OF CONTRACT

The Contractor shall execute and complete the Works as required by the Contract and in accordance with any direction given by the Superintendent.

The Principal shall pay the Contractor:
(a)	for work for which the Principal accepted a lump sum, the lump sum; or
(b)	for work for which the Principal accepted rates, the sum ascertained by multiplying the measured quantity of each item of work actually carried out under the Contract by the rate accepted by the Principal for the item,

3.	ASSIGNMENT AND SUBCONTRACTING

The Contractor shall not assign the Contract.

The Contractor shall not subcontract the whole or any part of the work under the Contract without the prior written approval of the Superintendent.

Subcontracting does not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility and liability under the Contract.

4.	SUPERINTENDENT

The Principal shall appoint a Superintendent and any direction, requirement, decision or determination of the Superintendent shall be binding on the Contractor.  The Superintendent may appoint, in writing, a Superintendent's Representative to exercise any function of the Superintendent under the Contract.

A direction may be given orally but the Superintendent shall as soon as practicable confirm it in writing.

5.	INSURANCE

The Contractor, before commencing work on the site, shall hold or effect a policy of insurance covering public liability to an amount of not less than the amount stated in the Annexure.

The policy shall be maintained until the Works have been completed.  The Contractor shall, on request of the Superintendent, promptly produce evidence of the insurance required under this Clause.  If the Contractor does not provide satisfactory evidence of compliance, the Principal may effect the relevant insurances and any costs and expenses incurred by the Principal in doing so will be a debt due and payable from the Contractor to the Principal.  The Principal may withhold payment until evidence of compliance with the Contractor's obligations under this clause is produced by the Contractor.

7.	MATERIALS AND QUALITY OF WORK

* notice has been given to the Contractor to rectify the default and it has not been rectified within 14 days of the notice or such other time as permitted by the Principal; or
* the standard of performance in executing the Works is such that the Principal's efficiency or the proper, safe and cost effective performance of the Principal's functions is affected,
the Principal may engage another Contractor to execute the Works or any part of the Works.  In this event, the cost of having the Works so carried out shall be deducted from the amount owing to the Contractor.

14.	TERMINATION
