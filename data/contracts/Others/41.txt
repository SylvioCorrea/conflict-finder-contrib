The parties further acknowledge that the role of the mediator is not to give legal or other professional advice to any party or make any decision for any of the parties, and that they will not be bound by, and will not rely on, any advice, opinions, recommendations, decisions or statements put forward by the mediator.  
2.	The mediator can meet with the parties jointly or separately, as appropriate.
3 Any information disclosed to the mediator in private, at any stage during the mediation process by a party or that party's adviser, will be treated by the mediator as confidential unless the party making the disclosure states otherwise in writing.
Mediator Disclosure and Limits
4 The mediator will disclose to the parties any prior association with any of the parties, their advisers or any other person present at the mediation, as well as any interest in the dispute.
5 If the mediator becomes aware at any time of circumstances which might impair the mediator's ability to act impartially, the mediator will cease to act as mediator unless the circumstances allow the mediator to inform the parties and the parties agree that the mediator may continue to mediate.
6.	The mediator will not accept any appointment from, or act for, any party in any capacity in any proceedings relating to the dispute.
Parties' Obligations
7.	Each party agrees to take part in the mediation in good faith and to co-operate with the mediator and others present. 
8.	The parties agree to ensure that they, and any advisers who will be attending the mediation, will participate in a preliminary conference with the mediator to discuss the process prior to the mediation itself, if requested by the mediator.  
9.	Each party agrees to be represented at the mediation by a person who will have the appropriate level of authority to settle the dispute. If this is not possible, they will inform the mediator and the other party(ies) and make arrangements that are acceptable to the parties.
Confidentiality
 10.	Each party agrees to ensure that any person who attends the mediation as a support person, or in another capacity, signs the Confidentiality Deed attached to this Agreement and provide it to the mediator, as a condition of their being allowed to attend the mediation.  
11. All documents created for the purpose of this mediation and all matters discussed throughout the mediation process are confidential.

12. The parties and the mediator agree not to disclose to anyone not involved in the mediation process any information or documentation received by them in preparation for, or during, the mediation process, and not to use that information or documentation for any purposes except the mediation, except to the extent that:
* is agreed in writing by all the parties to the mediation;
* is required by law;
* is required for the purpose of obtaining legal advice; or 
* the information becomes public knowledge otherwise than by reason of a breach of this agreement.
13. If it becomes necessary to disclose any information or documentation in accordance with clause 12, the disclosing party must ensure that any person receiving information or documentation, and their legal representative if there is one,  signs a Confidentiality Deed before the information or documentation is disclosed.
