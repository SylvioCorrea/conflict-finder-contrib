2 Sale and Purchase
The Seller sells the Sold Commodity to the Buyer.  The Seller shall take all actions required by the Scheme Rules to transfer the Sold Commodity to the Buyer by 2.00pm (Sydney time) on the Transfer Date, for which time is of the essence.  If the Seller is unable to transfer the Sold Commodity on the Transfer Date because of a Settlement Disruption Event, the Transfer Date will be the next Business Day on which the Settlement Disruption Event is no longer subsisting, and the Payment Date will be extended by a corresponding number of days. Prior to the Transfer Date, the Seller must issue to the Buyer a tax invoice setting out the Sold Commodity to be transferred from the Seller to the Buyer on the Transfer Date, the Unit Price and the total amount payable.

3 Transfer Fees
The Buyer shall pay any transfer fees imposed by the Scheme Rules or applicable registrar in respect of the transfer of the Sold Commodity, including stamp duty, and if the Seller is required by the Scheme Rules to pay any transfer fee or other similar expense associated with the transfer of the Sold Commodity, the Buyer shall reimburse such expense on demand.
4 Payment 
If the Contract Details provide for payment before the Transfer Date, the Buyer shall pay the Unit Price multiplied by the Sold Commodity, by transferring that sum to the Seller's Account on the Payment Date. If the Contract Details provide for payment on or after the Transfer Date, the Buyer shall pay the Unit Price multiplied by the quantity of Sold Commodity actually delivered for transfer on the Transfer Date, by transferring that sum to the Seller's Account on the Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if the tax invoice issued under clause 2 does not correctly reflect the quantity of the Sold Commodity actually delivered for transfer on the Transfer Date, the amount required to be paid under this clause shall be adjusted so that the Buyer pays the Seller the Unit Price multiplied by the quantity of the Sold Commodity actually delivered for transfer, and the Seller shall adjust the tax invoice accordingly.
5 Interest
The Buyer shall pay the Seller interest, compounded daily, at the Default Interest Rate on any late payment, from the Payment Date to the date that payment is made.
6 Title
Title to the Sold Commodity transferred in accordance with this Contract will transfer to the Buyer on the Transfer Date (as extended under clause 2, if relevant) or the date determined in accordance with the requirements of the Scheme Rules.
7 Warranties
The Seller warrants that, at the time of transfer to the Buyer, the Sold Commodity transferred to the Buyer under this Contract:
(a) has been created by or within the Creation Period;
(b) has been created in accordance with the requirements of the Scheme Rules;
(c) has not been generated or created from an Excluded Source;
(d) is owned by the Seller with full legal and beneficial title; and
(e) is free and clear of any security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance of any kind.
At the time of transfer of the Sold Commodity the Buyer and Seller each warrant to the other that they will comply with the Program or Scheme Rules as relevant as regards the Sold Commodity transferred to the Buyer under this Contract.
8 GST
If a party (" the supplier") is liable to pay goods and services tax ("GST") on a supply made by it under this Contract and issues a valid tax invoice to the other party ("the recipient") then the recipient agrees to pay to the supplier an additional amount equal to the consideration provided for the supply multiplied by the prevailing GST rate:
(a)if the tax invoice is issued prior to the Payment Date, on the Payment Date; and 
(b) if the tax invoice is issued on or after the Payment Date, within 10 days of the issue of the tax invoice. 
 Where any amount is payable as a reimbursement, indemnification or similar payment calculated by reference to a loss, cost, expense or other amount incurred, then that amount must be reduced by any input tax credit available to that party and, if a taxable supply, must be increased by the GST payable in relation to the supply and a tax invoice will be provided by the party being reimbursed or indemnified.
Terms defined in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 of Australia have the same meaning when used in this contract.
