7. Dispute Resolution Procedures
a) Disputes
If a dispute occurs between the parties, arising from the interpretation of any part of this agreement, the parties agree to resolve that dispute according to the processes set out below. The parties agree to be bound by any determination made through this process, whether it is a mediated settlement between the parties, or a decision of the arbitration panel described below.

b) Internal Grievance Mechanisms
Where the Provider has established an internal grievance mechanism, details of this mechanism will be given to the User by the Provider (in the User's preferred format) as soon as the Provider becomes aware that a dispute has arisen. The User is encouraged to utilise such a mechanism as the first method of resolving the dispute, but is not bound to do so under this agreement.

c) Independent Mediation
If the dispute is not resolved to the satisfaction of both parties according to clause 5(b) above, the parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute with the assistance of an independent mediator. The mediator will not determine the dispute, but will assist the parties to achieve a settlement with which they are both satisfied. If the parties cannot agree on the choice of a mediator, who should be a person qualified to undertake the task of mediation, then a mediator will be nominated by the President (at that time) of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Association of Australia.
d) Mediation Procedure
The mediation will occur at a time and place arranged by the mediator and agreed by the parties. Acceptance by either party of any mediated agreement will be voluntary. If such a mediated agreement is reached, the mediator will prepare it in writing and it will be confirmed by both parties. Both parties agree to be bound by the terms of any agreement reached through mediation.

e) Arbitration
If no agreement is reached through mediation, or if the mediation agreement is breached, either party may refer the dispute to the arbitration panel for determination. Details of the current membership of the panel will be available at the offices of the Provider or of Blind Citizens Australia. This panel shall consist of three persons. The chair of the panel shall be a person with expertise in the arbitration of disputes. This person shall be appointed from time to time, for periods of up to three years, by the Australian Blindness Forum. The Provider nominee shall be appointed from time to time, for periods of up to three years, by the providers of dog guides throughout Australia who undertake to provide dog guides according to the terms of this agreement. The User nominee shall be appointed from time to time, for periods of up to three years, by Blind Citizens Australia.

f) Operation Of The Panel
The Panel shall conduct the arbitration at a time and place to be determined by the Chair, in consultation with the other panel members, and convenient to both the parties. The Chair shall determine all questions of procedure, including how the arbitration is to be conducted, and whether people will participate in person, via telephone or through any other appropriate means. The Panel will operate informally, and will determine the dispute in an efficient and timely manner, but will be bound by the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. Decisions of the panel will be made by simple majority, and the decision of the Panel, with reasons for that decision, will be provided to the parties in their preferred formats within one month of the date of the conclusion of the hearing of the dispute.

g) Powers of the Panel
After hearing from each party to the dispute and from any other relevant person, the Panel may make a decision which, if appropriate, may include any one or more of the following:
(i) a decision that there has been a breach of the agreement by either or both parties and that the conduct in breach of the agreement should not be repeated or continued;
(ii) a decision that either the User or the Provider should perform any reasonable act or acts to redress any loss or damage suffered due to conduct in breach of this agreement
(iii) a decision that any party to the dispute should pay damages by way of compensation for any loss or damage directly flowing from the breach of this agreement. 
h)_Advocates
Parties may be represented at the hearing of the dispute by an advocate who may be legally qualified. However, the Chair shall be the sole arbiter of the way in which the hearing shall proceed, and shall not allow an advocate to unnecessarily complicate the dispute by use of legalistic forms or technicalities, to unreasonably prolong the hearing, or to cause an inappropriate power imbalance between the parties.
