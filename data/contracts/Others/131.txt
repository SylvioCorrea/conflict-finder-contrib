WHEREAS, Company offers a training course and support services designed to educate students regarding the trading techniques to be utilized in trading in certain futures contracts;

WHEREAS, Student desires to enroll in Company's training course; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, Company and Student agree as follows:

I. Training Course
A. Upon the Company's acceptance of this Agreement, the Company agrees to provide to the Student with instruction in trading via an online eCourse or in a manner selected by the Company.  The Company shall provide the Student with materials as the Company deems necessary to instruct and inform the Student.

B. Upon completion of the eCourse set forth in paragraph I.A., above, the Company shall provide the Student with materials to allow the Student to participate in trading simulations.  The Company will provide the Student with access to the 24/5 Live Trading Room for a period of five weeks (the "training period"), from the date the student activates his/her access.  At the commencement of the 3rd week, student also receives access to the PRO Trading Room (the advanced training room) for three weeks.  It is understood that the instructors will not provide advice or counsel in the form of trading recommendations.

II. Payment
In consideration for receiving the materials and services set forth in paragraph I., Student agrees to pay the sum of $7,750.00 AUD to the Company.  No refund will be given for any reason after the student receives the course materials.  

III. Non-Disclosure of Proprietary Information
Student acknowledges and understands that Company has devoted a substantial amount of time and effort, and has incurred substantial costs, in 
developing the course materials, the support services, and all information developed in connection with the training ("Proprietary Information").    
                                    							
Company's Proprietary Information includes, without limitation, training course, all written training course materials, marketing and advertising materials and methods, trading methods developed by Company, methods of operations, publications, and business practices.  Company derives economic value, both actual and potential, from not having its Proprietary Information generally known or ascertainable by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.  Additionally, Company has made substantial efforts to ensure that its Proprietary Information remains secret.
   
Student understands that during the training course he/she will gain access to Company's Proprietary Information.  While Student is certainly entitled, and in fact encouraged, to utilize all of the information obtained through the training course in pursuing his/her goal of learning successfully to trade futures contracts, Student covenants that he/she will not use said Proprietary Information for any purpose inconsistent with the terms and spirit of this Agreement.  Specifically, Student agrees that he/she shall not for any reason, at any time, without the written consent of Company, disclose to any person or entity any of Company's Proprietary Information.                                                            

IV. Covenant Not to Utilize Proprietary Information to Compete with Company
	Student covenants that he/she is enrolling in the training course for the 
sole purpose of becoming educated with the personal goal of learning to trade futures contracts.  Student covenants that he/she is not enrolling in the training course for reasons associated with competing with Company's business enterprise or otherwise obtaining Company's Proprietary Information for any use inconsistent with the teachings of this training course.  

Student acknowledges and agrees that Company has a valid and protectable interest in preserving its business enterprise of offering training courses that teach trading methodologies.  Consistent with the foregoing, Student agrees, that for a period of three (3) years after Student enrolls in Company's training course, he/she will not, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or on behalf of or in conjunction with others, as principal, agent, servant, or otherwise, to engage in, or have an interest in, the same or competitive line of business, such as trading hotline, chat room, trading software, or similar business enterprise, now carried on by Company anywhere in the world.

V. Reasonableness and Enforceability
The parties hereto have attempted to limit the restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement to the extent necessary reasonably to protect Company's   legitimate business interests.  Student acknowledges that the scope of paragraph III, restricting the disclosure of Company's Proprietary Information, is reasonable.  Student also acknowledges that the scope of paragraph IV, restricting the use of Company's Proprietary Information to compete against the Company, is also reasonable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties recognize that reasonable people may differ in making such a determination.  Consequently, the parties hereby agree that if the scope or enforceability of the covenants set forth in this Agreement is in any way disputed at any time, a court or other trier-of-fact may modify and enforce the covenants to the extent that it believes the covenants to be reasonable under the circumstances existing at that time.
