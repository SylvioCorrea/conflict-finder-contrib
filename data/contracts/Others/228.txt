TRADING CONDITIONS 

Nature of Services 
(1) The Company carries on business as a licensed Customs Broker and forwarding agent. All Services provided by the Company are governed solely by these Trading Conditions which, shall prevail over the Customer's terms and conditions and any terms and conditions contained in any transport document including any bill of lading, waybill or consignment note except to the extent provided for in these Trading Conditions. The Company is not a common carrier and will accept no liability as such. The Company may refuse at its sole and absolute discretion to accept any Goods for carriage without assigning any reason. 
(2) No modification amendments or other variation of the Trading Conditions shall be valid and binding on the Company unless made in writing and duly executed by and on behalf of the Company. 
(3) The Company acknowledges that where, terms of Carriage are limited pursuant to convention, statute, law, bill of lading or airway bill, and the transport of the goods extends or requires transport outside and beyond the terms provided for in that convention, statute, law, bill of lading or airway bill then the Customer may be required to enter into a further contractual agreement with the forwarder or carrier regarding that portion of transport in order to limit liability on behalf of the forwarder or carrier, or where the transport was unforseen, the limitation of liability provisions in place for the foreseen transport will extend to the unforeseen transport, even where that liability provision does not envision transport of that kind.

Standing or general instructions, or instructions given late, even if received by the Company without comment, shall not be binding upon the Company. If the Company adopts standing or general instructions, or instructions given late, for one of more transaction for the Customer or any other party, that does not in any way affect the validity of those instructions in relation to any future transaction.

THE COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE A CHANGE IN THE RATES OF DUTY, WHARFAGE, FREIGHT, RAILAGE OR CARTAGE, OR ANY OTHER TARIFF BEFORE OR AFTER THE PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANY OR ANY ACT INVOLVING A LESS FAVOURABLE RATE OR TARIFF, OR BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT A SAVING MAY HAVE BEEN EFFECTED IN SOME OTHER WAY HAD ANY ACT BEEN PERFORMED AT A DIFFERENT TIME AND WHETHER ITS PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF THE ACTS AFORESAID IS DELAYED OR PRECIPITATED THROUGH THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SERVANTS OR AGENTS OR HOWEVER CAUSED.
