Background
A. The Association owns the trade mark in the Schedule (Trade Mark).
B. In exchange for their mutual obligations, the parties have agreed that the Company can use the Trade Mark on the terms specified in this agreement.
Operative Provisions
1. The Association will provide a copy of the Trade Mark to the Company as the template which the Company can use to reproduce the Trade Mark.
2. The Association grants to the Company a royalty free licence to reproduce the Trade Mark for advertising and promotional purposes only in printed material and to communicate the Trade Mark to the public by posting it on the Company's website or including it in Company emails.  Likewise, the Company can link its website to the Association's website.  In so doing, the Company must exactly reproduce the Trade Mark (including the Trade Mark symbol and the designation of the Association as the owner of the Trade Mark).  The Company can authorise third parties to do these things on its behalf in relation to the production of the Company's printed material and website, but cannot authorise the use the Trade Mark in third party printed material or websites.
3. The Company must not use the Trade Mark in relation to any services that are provided by any person other than the Association (or its licensees) and acknowledges that all goodwill that accrues to the Trade Mark belongs to the Association.
4. The Company must not use the Trade Mark in any way that will adversely affect the Association's reputation.  Every description of the services provided by the Association must be accurate and not misleading.  The Association has the sole discretion to determine whether the Company complies with this clause.
5. At the Association's request, the Company must provide the Association with samples of its material that includes the Trade Mark.
6. If the Company breaches an obligation under this agreement, it must undertake whatever remedial action the Association reasonably requires at the Company's expense.  This may include destroying printed material that is not of sufficient quality or actively correcting any impression that has or may have adversely affected the Association's reputation.  This clause will survive the termination of this agreement.
7. This agreement can be terminated by either party by giving notice to the other.  If this agreement is terminated, the Company must immediately deliver all of the Association's artwork or other property to the Association and must destroy all material in its power, possession or control that includes the Trade Mark.  Any electronic copies of the Trade Mark (including those on the Company's website) must be permanently deleted.
