1.	Confidentiality.  Each Party will (a) use the same means it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in any event not less than reasonable means, to prevent the disclosure and protect the confidentiality of information, whether electronic, oral or written, communicated to it by the disclosing Party (the "Disclosing Party") during the Exchange Period in connection with the Business Purpose (the "Confidential Information"), and (b) use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information only in connection with the Business Purpose.  Each Party may disclose this Agreement and the other Party's Confidential Information to those employees of the recipient Party (the "Recipient Party") who have a need to have access to such Confidential Information in connection with their employment by the Recipient Party, so long as the Recipient Party advises such employees of the confidentiality obligations set out in this Agreement.  Compliance by employees with the confidentiality obligations in this Agreement will remain the responsibility of the Party employing such persons.  With respect to any particular Confidential Information, the Recipient Party's obligations under this Agreement will expire three (3) years after the Recipient Party's receipt of that Confidential Information.  Neither Party will make or issue, or cause to be made or issued, any announcement or statement regarding activities under this Agreement for dissemination to the general public or any third party without the prior written consent of the other Party.

Confidential Information will not include information which (a) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Recipient Party to the public or any third party in violation of this Agreement, (b) becomes available to the Recipient Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party, provided that the Recipient Party has no reason to believe that such source is itself bound by a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement with the Disclosing Party or otherwise prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, (c) was rightfully in the Recipient Party's possession prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (d) is independently developed by the Recipient Party without the use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.  If Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by the Recipient Party by a governmental agency or law, such Confidential Information may be disclosed pursuant to such requirement so long as the Recipient Party provides the Disclosing Party with written notice of the required disclosure promptly upon receipt of notice of the required disclosure, to the extent permitted by law, and coordinates with the Disclosing Party in an effort to limit the nature and scope of such required disclosure. 

3.	Right to Terminate Discussions.  The provision of Confidential Information and discussions held in connection with the Business Purpose will not prevent either Party from pursuing similar discussions or transactions with third parties, or obligate either Party to continue discussions with the other Party or to take, continue or forego any action relating to the Business Purpose.  Any proposals, estimates or forecasts provided by either Party to the other Party will not constitute commitments.  Either Party may terminate discussions regarding the Business Purpose at any time, without any liability or obligation whatsoever, except as expressly set out in this Agreement or in the letters of appointment between the parties.

4.  Return of Confidential Information.  Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient Party will, at the Recipient Party's option, either return all of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, including all copies, or certify in writing that all of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information and all copies thereof have been destroyed.
